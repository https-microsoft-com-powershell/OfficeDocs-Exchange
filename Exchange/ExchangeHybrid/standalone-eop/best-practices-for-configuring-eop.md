# Best practices for configuring standalone EOP

Follow these best-practice recommendations for standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) in order to set yourself up for success and avoid common configuration errors. This article assumes that you've already completed the setup process. If you haven't completed EOP setup, see [Set up your EOP service](set-up-your-eop-service.md).

## Use a test domain

We recommend that you use a test domain, subdomain, or low volume domain for trying out service features before implementing them on your higher-volume, production domains.

## Synchronize recipients

If your organization has existing user accounts in an on-premises Active Directory environment, you can synchronize those accounts to Azure Active Directory in the cloud. Using directory synchronization is recommended. To learn more about the benefits of using directory synchronization, and the steps for setting it up, see [Manage mail users in EOP](manage-mail-users-in-eop.md).

## Recommended settings

We empower security admins to customize their security settings to satisfy the needs of their organization. Although, as a general rule, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: Standard and Strict. These settings are listed in the [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365).

### Miscellaneous/non-policy settings

These settings cover a range of features that are outside of security policies.

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshoot general issues and trends by using the reports in the admin center. Find single point specific data about a message by using the message trace tool. Learn more about reporting at [Reporting and message trace in Exchange Online Protection](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/reporting-and-message-trace-in-exchange-online-protection). Learn more about the message trace tool at [Message trace in the Security & Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/message-trace-scc).

## Report false positives and false negatives to Microsoft

To help improve spam filtering in the service for everyone, you should report false positives (good email marked as bad) and false negatives (bad email allowed) to Microsoft for analysis. For more information, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft).

## Create mail flow rules

Create mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) or custom filters to meet your business needs.

When you deploy a new rule to production, select one of the test modes first to see the effect of the rule. Once you are satisfied that the rule is working in the manner intended, change the rule mode to **Enforce**.

When you deploy new rules, consider adding the additional action of **Generate Incident Report** to monitor the rule in action.

In hybrid environments where your organization includes both on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online, consider the conditions that you use in mail flow rules. If you want the rules to apply to the entire organization, be sure to use conditions that are available in both on-premises Exchange and in Exchange Online. While most conditions are available in both environments, there are a few that are only available in one environment or the other. Learn more at [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules).
