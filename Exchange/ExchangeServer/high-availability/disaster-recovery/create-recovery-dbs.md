# Create a recovery database

You can use the Exchange Management Shell to create a recovery database, a special kind of mailbox database that's used to mount and extract data from the restored database as part of a recovery operation. After you create a recovery database, you can move a recovered or restored mailbox database into the recovery database, and then use the [New-MailboxRestoreRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxrestorerequest) cmdlet to extract data from the recovered database. After extraction, the data can then be exported to a folder or merged into an existing mailbox. Using recovery databases, you can recover data from a backup or copy of a database without disrupting user access to current data.

Looking for other management tasks related to recovery databases? Check out [Recovery databases](recovery-databases.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this task: 1 minute

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox recovery" entry in the [Recipients Permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/recipient-permissions.md)topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/exchange-admin-center-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to create a recovery database

This example creates the recovery database RDB1 on the Mailbox server MBX2.

```powershell
New-MailboxDatabase -Recovery -Name RDB1 -Server MBX2
```

This example creates the recovery database RDB2 on the Mailbox server MBX1 using a custom path for the database file and log folder.

```powershell
New-MailboxDatabase -Recovery -Name RDB2 -Server MBX1 -EdbFilePath "C:\Recovery\RDB2\RDB2.EDB" -LogFolderPath "C:\Recovery\RDB2"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MailboxDatabase](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxdatabase).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created a recovery database, do the following:

- In the Exchange Management Shell, run the following command to display configuration information for the recovery database.

  ```powershell
  Get-MailboxDatabase <RecoveryDatabaseName> | Format-List
  ```

## Other Tasks

After you create a recovery database, you may also want to restore data using a recovery database. For detailed steps, see [Restore data using a recovery database](restore-data-using-recovery-dbs.md).
