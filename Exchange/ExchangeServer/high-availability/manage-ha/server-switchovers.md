# Perform a server switchover

A server switchover is part of preparing for a scheduled outage for the current Mailbox server.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 30 seconds per database

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Database availability groups" entry in the [High availability and site resilience permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/ha-permissions.md) topic.

## Use the EAC to perform a server switchover

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the"Mailbox database copies" entry in the [High availability and site resilience permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/ha-permissions.md) topic.

1. In the EAC, go to **Servers** \> **servers**.

2. Select the Mailbox server you want to switchover.

3. In the details pane, select **Server Switchover**.

4. On the **Server Switchover** page, do one of the following:

1. Accept the default setting of **Automatically choose a target server** (in which case, the system automatically selects the best Mailbox server for each database being switched over), and then click **save**.

2. Click **Use the specified server as the target for switchover**, click **Browse** to select a Mailbox server, and then click **save**.

5. When the switchover has completed, click **close** to exit the **Server Switchover** page.

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to perform a server switchover

This example performs a server switchover for the server MBX1. The system automatically selects the best Mailbox server for each active database on MBX1.

```powershell
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase -Server MBX1
```

This example performs a server switchover of the Mailbox server MBX4. When the command completes, MBX5 hosts the active copy of the databases that were previously active on MBX4.

```powershell
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase -Server MBX4 -ActivateOnServer MBX5
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase](/powershell/module/exchange/move-activemailboxdatabase).
