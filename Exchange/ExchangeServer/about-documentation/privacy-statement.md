# Exchange Server Privacy Statement

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy, while delivering software that brings you the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing. This privacy statement applies to Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019. It focuses on features that communicate with the Internet. It does not apply to any other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services.

Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 deliver email, calendaring, contact management, and other online collaboration functionalities on your PC's, mobile phones, and web browsers.

This privacy statement addresses the deployment and use of Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 in an enterprise network environment. If you use Exchange Server technologies as a service operated by Microsoft or a third party, please refer to the service-specific privacy and security policies provided by Microsoft or the third-party service provider.

IT administrators of Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 may choose to enable or disable certain Internet-enabled features in Exchange, or to deploy other privacy impacting technologies, based on legal or compliance considerations or internal policies. You should direct privacy-related requests related to the entity that's providing your access to Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of its customers or other third parties.

## Collection and Use of Your Information

The information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features you're using and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. It may also be used to analyze and improve Microsoft products and services.

We may send standard service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Microsoft services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may occasionally request your feedback, invite you to participate in surveys, or send you promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.

 **Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent.**

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as answering customer questions about products or services or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will provide those companies only the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.

Information that is collected by or sent to Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 may be stored and processed in the United States or in any other country/region in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

 **Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer**

When you use software with Internet-enabled features, information about your computer ("standard computer information") is sent to the web sites you visit and online services you use. Microsoft uses standard computer information to provide you Internet-enabled services, to help improve our products and services, and for statistical analysis. Standard computer information typically includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, browser version, and regional and language settings. In some cases, standard computer information may also include hardware ID, which indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular feature or service sends information to Microsoft, standard computer information will be sent as well.

The privacy details for other Exchange 2016 or Exchange 2019 features, software, or services listed in this privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it is used.

 **Security of Your Information**

Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, information you provide is stored on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.

 **Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted**: For information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by Microsoft Error Reporting, see [Privacy Statement for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service](https://privacy.microsoft.com/microsoft-error-reporting-privacy-statement).

 **Use of Information**: The error reporting data that you submit may be used to solve customer problems and to improve Microsoft software and services.

In addition, your IT administrator can choose to enable or disable Microsoft Error Reporting during the Exchange Server setup process for all users.

In rare cases, such as problems that are especially difficult to solve, Microsoft may request additional data, including sections of memory (which may include memory shared by any or all applications running at the time the problem occurred), some registry settings, and one or more files from your computer. Your current documents may also be included. When additional data is requested, you will have an opportunity to view the information contained in the error report before choosing whether or not to send the report to Microsoft.

 **Important Information**: Enterprise customers can use Group Policy to configure how Microsoft Error Reporting works on their computers. Configuration options include the ability to turn off Microsoft Error Reporting. If you're an administrator and want to configure Group Policy for Microsoft Error Reporting, technical details are available at the [Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows and Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=25250).
