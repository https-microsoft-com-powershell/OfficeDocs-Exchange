# Outlook for iOS and Android

Outlook for iOS and Android supports two authentication types in Exchange on-premises environments: _Basic authentication_ and _hybrid Modern Authentication_.

Outlook for iOS and Android uses Basic authentication with Exchange ActiveSync in the following environments:

- In Exchange Server 2010 environments

- When a hybrid relationship with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 has not been configured

- When hybrid Modern Authentication has not been enabled

For more information see [Using Basic authentication with Outlook for iOS and Android](use-basic-auth.md).

For customers running Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, or Exchange Server 2019 in a hybrid relationship with Microsoft 365 or Office 365, Outlook for iOS and Android can be configured to leverage hybrid Modern Authentication. For more information, see [Using hybrid Modern Authentication with Outlook for iOS and Android](use-hybrid-modern-auth.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The [Outlook for iOS and Android Help Center](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cd84214e-a5ac-4e95-9ea3-e07f78d0cde6) is available for users, including help for using the app on specific devices and troubleshooting information.
