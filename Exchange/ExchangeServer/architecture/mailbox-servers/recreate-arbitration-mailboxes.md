# Recreate missing arbitration mailboxes

Exchange 2016 CU8 or later contains seven special system mailboxes known as *arbitration mailboxes*. Arbitration mailboxes are used for storing different types of system data and for managing messaging approval workflow. The following table lists each type of arbitration mailbox and their responsibilities.

If you need to re-create one of more of these arbitration mailboxes, use the instructions in this article.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes per procedure.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform these procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" section in the [Recipients Permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/recipient-permissions.md) topic.

- To run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD`, your account needs to be a member of the Enterprise Admins security group.

- The computer that you use to run `Setup.exe /PrepareAD` requires access to Setup.exe in the Exchange installation files:
  1. Use your most recently downloaded copy of the Exchange ISO image file, or download an updated copy from [Updates for Exchange Server](../../new-features/updates.md).
  2. In File Explorer, right-click on the Exchange ISO image file and then select **Mount**. Note the virtual DVD drive letter that's assigned.
  3. Open a Windows Command Prompt window. For example:
     - Press the Windows key + 'R' to open the **Run** dialog, type cmd.exe, and then press **OK**.
     - Press **Start**. In the **Search** box, type **Command Prompt**, then in the list of results, select **Command Prompt**.

- For more information about opening the Exchange Management Shell, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

```powershell
Set-ADServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true; Get-Mailbox -Arbitration | Format-Table Name,DisplayName
```

View the results of the command to verify that appropriate system mailbox, either by Name or Display Name from the above table, has been re-created.
