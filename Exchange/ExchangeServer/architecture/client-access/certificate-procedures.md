# Certificate procedures in Exchange Server

Ensuring that certificates are installed and configured correctly is key to delivering a secure messaging infrastructure for the enterprise. In Exchange Server you can manage certificates in the Exchange admin center (EAC), and in the Exchange Management Shell. Certificate management in the EAC has been improved over certificate management in the Exchange Management Console in Exchange Server 2010. Specifically, certificate management in the EAC can help administrators by:

- Minimizing the number of certificates that are required.

- Minimizing the interaction that's required for certificates.

- Allowing the centralized installation and management of certificates on all Exchange servers in the organization.

For more information about certificates in Exchange, see [Digital certificates and encryption in Exchange Server](certificates.md).

The tasks that are associated with certificate management in Exchange are described in the following table.

|**Task**|**EAC**|**Exchange Management Shell**|**Topic**|**Comments**|
