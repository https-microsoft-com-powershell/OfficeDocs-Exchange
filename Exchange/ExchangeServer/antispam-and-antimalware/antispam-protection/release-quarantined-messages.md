# Release quarantined messages from the spam quarantine mailbox

After you configure the spam quarantine mailbox in Exchange Server, you can use **Resend this message** in Microsoft Outlook to release quarantined messages to their intended recipients. To configure the spam quarantine mailbox, see [Configure a spam quarantine mailbox](configure-quarantine-mailboxes.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this procedure: less than 5 minutes

- **Resend this message** isn't available in Outlook on the web. You need to configure an Outlook profile that you use to access the spam quarantine mailbox. For more information about configuring and using multiple Outlook profiles, see [Overview of Outlook email profiles](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d).

- To make it easier to locate the message you that want to recover, you can create a custom Outlook form to show the original sender and recipients in the message view. For detailed steps, see [Configure Outlook to show the original sender in the spam quarantine mailbox](show-quarantined-message-original-senders.md).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox access" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/mail-flow-permissions.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/exchange-admin-center-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Use Outlook 2010 or later to release a message from the spam quarantine mailbox

1. Open the spam quarantine mailbox in Outlook on a client computer.

2. In the **Mail** view, find the message you want to recover in the **Inbox**, and then double-click the message to open it.

3. In the **Move** section of the Ribbon, click **Actions** \> **Resend this Message**.

4. When the message opens, click **Send** to resend the message to the intended recipient.

 **Note**: **Resend this message** doesn't work on multiple messages. You need to resend them one at a time.

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully released the message from the spam quarantine mailbox, contact the recipient and verify that they received the message.
