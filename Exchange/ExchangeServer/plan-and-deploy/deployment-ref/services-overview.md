# Overview of Exchange services on Exchange servers

During the installation of Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2019, Setup runs a set of tasks that install new services in Microsoft Windows. A service is a background process that can be launched during the startup of the server by the Windows Service Control Manager. Services are executable files designed to operate independently and without administrative intervention. A service can run using either a graphical user interface (GUI) mode or a console mode.

All previous versions of Exchange included components that are implemented as services. Each Exchange server role includes services that are part of (or may be needed by) the server role to perform its functions. Note that some services only become active when specific features are used.

The sections in this topic describe the various services that are installed by Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2016 on Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers. For services that are labeled as optional, you can disable the service if you determine your organization doesn't need the functionality that's provided by the service.

## Exchange services on Mailbox servers

The following table describes the Exchange services that are installed on Mailbox servers.
