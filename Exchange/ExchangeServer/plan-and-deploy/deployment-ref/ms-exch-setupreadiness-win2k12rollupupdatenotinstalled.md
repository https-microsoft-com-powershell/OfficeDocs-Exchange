Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup has detected that the computer you're attempting to install Exchange 2016 on doesn't have a recommended Windows update installed. We strongly recommend that you install this Windows update before installing Exchange 2016 to avoid any issues resolved by the update.

A Windows Server 2012 update rollup that resolves several issues, including those that could cause Resilient File System (ReFS)-formatted disks to perform unreliably, hasn't been installed.

Download and install the 64-bit update from the following URL, and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.

> [!NOTE]
