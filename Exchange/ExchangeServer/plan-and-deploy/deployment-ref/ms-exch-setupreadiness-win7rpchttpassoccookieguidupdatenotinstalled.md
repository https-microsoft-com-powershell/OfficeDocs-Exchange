# KB2619234 update not installed [Win7RpcHttpAssocCookieGuidUpdateNotInstalled]

Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You'll need to install this update before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue.

Exchange 2016 Setup requires a Windows Server update that allows Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP) to work correctly.

Download and install the 64-bit update from [KB2619234](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2619234), and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
