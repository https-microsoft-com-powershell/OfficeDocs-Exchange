# Exchange Server 2010 load balancer deployment

This page describes which server load balancer partners have completed solution testing with Exchange Server 2010 and contains pointers to accompanying deployment white papers hosted by the partner.

## About the qualification program

The qualification program for load balancers is designed to ensure that customers have seamless experiences with setup, support, and use of qualified load balancers with Microsoft's Exchange Server 2010. Only products that meet Exchange Server 2010 requirements will be listed.

The qualification program for our load balancer partners is defined as follows:

- Specific requirements for interoperability with Exchange Server 2010
- Testing scenario requirements for qualifying interoperability with Exchange Server 2010
- Quick Start Guide for installation and configuration requirements
- Vendor Release Notes documenting any known issues
- Enterprise-class standards for reliability and scalability

The program is designed to ensure that interoperability is tested by the vendor to meet Exchange Server 2010 requirements in a consistent and supportable manner.

> [!NOTE]
> The qualification program described here is not a Microsoft certification or logo program. Microsoft makes no warranties or representations with regard to the third-party solutions included in the program, including without limitation the supportability of such third-party solutions. Support for the specific implementation of third-party products within an Exchange solution is provided by the third-party vendor under the terms agreed between you and the vendor. You are solely responsible for selecting, evaluating, and determining whether any third-party offering listed on this site is appropriate for your use.
