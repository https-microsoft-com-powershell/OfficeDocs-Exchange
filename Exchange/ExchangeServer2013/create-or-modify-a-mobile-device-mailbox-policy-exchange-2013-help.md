# Create or modify a mobile device mailbox policy

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

A mobile device mailbox policy allows you to apply a common set of security and mobile device settings to a group of users. You can create multiple mobile device mailbox policies. Each recipient in your organization must have a mobile device mailbox policy assigned to them. When you install Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, a default mobile device mailbox policy is created and new users are automatically assigned this policy. To assign specific users to a mobile device mailbox policy, see [Add or remove users from a mobile mailbox policy](add-or-remove-users-from-a-mobile-mailbox-policy-exchange-2013-help.md).

For additional information related to mobile device mailbox policies, see [Mobile device mailbox policies](mobile-device-mailbox-policies-exchange-2013-help.md).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mobile Device mailbox policy" entry in the [Clients and mobile devices permissions](clients-and-mobile-devices-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

## Use the EAC to create a new mobile device mailbox policy

You can create a new mobile device mailbox policy using the EAC.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set a subset of mobile device mailbox policy settings in the EAC. To set all the mobile device mailbox policy settings, you need to use the Shell.

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device Mailbox Policies**, and then click **New**.

2. Use the various check boxes and drop-down lists to configure the settings for the mobile device mailbox policy.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Select <STRONG>This is the default policy</STRONG> to make the new mobile mailbox policy the default mobile mailbox policy. After you make a mobile mailbox policy the default policy, all new users will be assigned this policy automatically when they are created.

3. Click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to create a new mobile device mailbox policy

You create a new mobile device mailbox policy using the New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy cmdlet.

> [!WARNING]
> There are two cmdlets that can be used to create a new mobile device mailbox policy. The <STRONG>New-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy</STRONG> cmdlet and the <STRONG>New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy</STRONG> cmdlets perform identical tasks. In a future version of Microsoft Exchange Server, the <STRONG>New-ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy</STRONG> cmdlet will be removed. We recommend that you update your scripts and procedures to use the <STRONG>New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy</STRONG> cmdlet.

1. In the Shell, run the following command.

   ```powershell
   New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Name:"Management" -AllowBluetooth:$true -AllowBrowser:$true -AllowCamera:$true -AllowPOPIMAPEmail:$false -PasswordEnabled:$true -AlphanumericPasswordRequired:$true -PasswordRecoveryEnabled:$true -MaxEmailAgeFilter:10 -AllowWiFi:$true -AllowStorageCard:$true -AllowPOPIMAPEmail:$false
   ```

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created a mobile device mailbox policy, use one of the following options:

1. In the EAC, click **Mobile** \> **Mobile Device mailbox policies**, and verify that your new policy is displayed in the List view.

2. In the Shell, run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Get-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Identity <PolicyName>
   ```

## Edit an existing mobile device mailbox policy
