# Enable faxing for a group of users in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable inbound faxes for users linked with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. By default, when you enable users for Unified Messaging, users can't receive fax messages until you specify the URI for the fax partner server, deploy a fax partner server for your organization, and enable faxing on a UM mailbox policy. If the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on the UM dial plan, the users linked with the UM mailbox policy still won't be able to receive faxes. Similarly, if the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on an individual user, that user won't be able to receive faxes.

For additional management tasks related to faxing, see [Faxing procedures](faxing-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

2. On the **UM dial plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the mailbox policy you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM mailbox policy** page \> **General**, select the check box next to **Allow inbound faxes**.

## Use the Shell to enable inbound faxing

This example allows users who are linked with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` to use inbound faxing.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowFax $true
```
