# Call answering rules in the same mailbox policy in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can allow users who are associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy to configure call answering rules, or prevent them from doing so. If the option to configure call answering rules is disabled on a UM dial plan, the Call Answering Rules feature won't be available to UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy. The default setting is enabled.

For additional management tasks related to allowing users to forward calls, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to enable or disable call answering rules on a UM mailbox policy

This example allows users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` to create call answering rules.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowCallAnsweringRules $true
```

This example prevents users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` from creating call answering rules.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowCallAnsweringRules $false
```
