# Remove an E.164 number in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When you enable a user for UM and link them to an E.164 dial plan, two EUM proxy addresses are created. One contains the user's extension number and the other contains the E.164 number for the user. The extension number is used when the user calls in to an Outlook Voice Access number.

You can remove the primary E.164 number that was added when the user was enabled for UM or a secondary E.164 number that was added later, along with the EUM proxy addresses for the user. The primary E.164 number you added when the user was enabled for UM will be listed as the primary EUM proxy address. Any additional E.164 numbers you added will be listed as secondary EUM proxy addresses. When an E.164 number is removed, callers can no longer leave voice mail for the user at the E.164 number that was removed.

If you remove the primary E.164 number, UM won't be able to send voice mail to the user's mailbox and call answering rules won't be processed. After you remove the primary E.164 number, the EUM proxy address for the user will be listed as **Null** on the user's mailbox in the EAC and when you run the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet in the Shell. Also, when you run the **Get-UMMailbox** cmdlet, the _Extensions_, _PhoneNumber_, and _CallAnsweringRulesExtensions_ parameters will be blank or null.

You can use the EAC or the Shell to remove a primary or a secondary E.164 number for a user. You can use the **Email Address** page on the user's mailbox in the EAC to remove a primary or a secondary E.164 number. You can't use the **UM Mailbox** page in the EAC to remove a primary or secondary E.164 number.

You can view the primary and secondary E.164 numbers for a user by using the **Get-UMMailbox** cmdlet or the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet in the Shell.

For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the EAC to remove the primary or a secondary E.164 number

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. In the list view, select the mailbox from which you want to remove an E.164 number, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **User Mailbox** page, under **Email address**, select the E.164 number that you want to remove from the list, and then click **Delete** ![Delete icon](images/ITPro_EAC_DeleteIcon.gif). The primary EUM proxy address or E.164 number is listed in bold letters and numbers.

4. Click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to remove the primary or a secondary E.164 number

This example removes the E.164 number +14255551010 from the mailbox of Tony Smith, a UM-enabled user.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you remove an E.164 number using the Shell, you need to determine the position of the EUM proxy address that you want to modify. To determine the position, use the **$mbx.EmailAddresses** command. The first EUM proxy address in the list will be 0.

```powershell
$mbx = Get-Mailbox tony.smith
$mbx.EmailAddresses.Item(1) -="eum:+14255551010;phone-context=MyDialPlan.contoso.com"
Set-Mailbox tony.smith -EmailAddresses $mbx.EmailAddresses
```
