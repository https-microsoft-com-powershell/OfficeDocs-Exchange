Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the attempt to install the server role failed.

Microsoft Exchange setup requires that the local domain be prepared for Exchange Server 2007 before certain server roles can be installed.

Preparation of the domain for Exchange Server 2007 consists of the following tasks:

  - Setting permissions on the Domain container for the Exchange Servers, Exchange Organization Administrators, Authenticated Users, and Exchange Mailbox Administrators.

  - Creating the Microsoft Exchange System Objects container if it does not exist, and setting permissions on this container for the Exchange Servers, Exchange Organization Administrators, and Authenticated Users.

  - Creating a new domain global group in the current domain called Exchange Install Domain Servers.

  - Adding the Exchange Install Domain Servers group to the Exchange Servers USG in the root domain.

To resolve this issue, run **setup /PrepareDomain** to prepare the local domain and retry the server role installation.

For more information about how to perform the PrepareDomain process, see "How to Prepare Active Directory and Domains" ([https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb125224(v=exchg.80)](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb125224(v=exchg.80))).
