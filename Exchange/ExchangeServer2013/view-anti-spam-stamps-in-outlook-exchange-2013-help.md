# View anti-spam stamps in Outlook

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use Microsoft Outlook to view the anti-spam stamps that Microsoft Exchange applied to an email message. Anti-spam stamps help you diagnose spam-related problems by applying diagnostic metadata, or stamps, such as sender-specific information, puzzle validation results, and content filtering results to messages as the messages pass through the anti-spam agents that filter inbound messages from the Internet.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 15 minutes

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox access" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](mail-flow-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
