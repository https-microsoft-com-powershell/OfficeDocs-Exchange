# ExecutionPolicy GPO is defined

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can't continue because it detected that the **ExecutionPolicy** Group Policy Object (GPO) defines one or both of the following policies:

  - **MachinePolicy**

  - **UserPolicy**

It doesn't matter how the policies have been defined. It only matters that they have been defined.

When you run Exchange 2013 Setup, Exchange stops and disables the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. When either of these policies are defined, the WMI service needs to be enabled to run a Windows PowerShell script. If the policies are defined and the WMI service is stopped, Setup will fail and the server will be left in an inconsistent state.

To allow Setup to continue, you need to temporarily remove any definition of **MachinePolicy** or **UserPolicy** in the **ExecutionPolicy** GPO:

```PowerShell
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell -Name ExecutionPolicy â€“Value ""
```
