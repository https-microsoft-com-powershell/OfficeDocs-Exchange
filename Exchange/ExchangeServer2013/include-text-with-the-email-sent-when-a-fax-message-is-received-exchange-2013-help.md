# Include text with the email message sent when a fax message is received in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can include additional text in the email message that's sent when a fax message is received by a user who is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) voice mail and is fax-enabled, and when the UM mailbox policy has been configured correctly to use a fax partner provider. By default, the text included when a UM-enabled user receives a fax message indicates only that the user has received a fax message. However, you can create a custom message by adding text in the **When a user receives a fax message** box on a UM mailbox policy. For example, the text can include information about system security policies and describe the correct way to handle fax messages in your organization. After you add the text, it will be included in each email message that's sent when UM-enabled users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy receive a fax message.

> [!NOTE]
> The custom text that accompanies a fax message is limited to 512 characters, and can include simple HTML text.

For additional management tasks related to faxing, see [Faxing procedures](faxing-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to change the text included with a fax message

This example enables UM-enabled users who are associated with a UM mailbox policy to receive additional instructions on how to open a fax message that they've received in their mailbox.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -FaxMessageText "To open this fax message, double-click the file attachment."
```
