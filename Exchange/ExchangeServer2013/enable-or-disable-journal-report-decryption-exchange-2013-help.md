# Enable or Disable Journal Report Decryption

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Enabling journal report decryption allows the Journaling agent to attach a decrypted copy of a rights-protected message to the journal report. Before you enable journal report decryption, you must add the Federated Delivery mailbox to the super users group configured on your [Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831364(v=ws.11)) server.

For additional management tasks related to Information Rights Management (IRM), see [Information Rights Management procedures](information-rights-management-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 1 minute

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Rights protection" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- Members of the super users group are granted an owner use license when they request a license from the AD RMS cluster. This allows them to decrypt all RMS-protected content created by that AD RMS cluster.

- An AD RMS cluster must be installed in the Active Directory forest.

- The Federated Delivery mailbox has been added to an AD RMS super users group. For details, see [Add the Federation Mailbox to the AD RMS Super Users Group](add-the-federation-mailbox-to-the-ad-rms-super-users-group-exchange-2013-help.md).

- You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to enable journal report decryption. You must use the Shell.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to enable journal report decryption

This example enables journal report decryption for the Exchange organization.

```powershell
Set-IRMConfiguration -JournalReportDecryptionEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-IRMConfiguration](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-IRMConfiguration).

## Use the Shell to disable journal report decryption

This example disables journal report decryption for the Exchange organization.

```powershell
Set-IRMConfiguration -JournalReportDecryptionEnabled $false
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-IRMConfiguration](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-IRMConfiguration).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have enabled or disabled journal report decryption, run the **Get-IRMConfiguration** cmdlet and check the value of the *JournalDecryptionEnabled* property.

For an example of how to check the IRM configuration, see [Examples](/powershell/module/exchange/get-irmconfiguration#examples) in **Get-IRMConfiguration**.
