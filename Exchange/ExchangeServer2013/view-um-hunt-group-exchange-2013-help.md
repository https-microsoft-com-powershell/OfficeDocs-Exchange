# View a UM hunt group in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When you view the properties for a Unified Messaging (UM) hunt group, you can view the properties associated with a single UM hunt group or with all UM hunt groups associated with a single UM IP gateway. If neither parameter is specified, all UM hunt groups will be returned. You can't use the EAC to view UM hunt group properties; you must use the Shell.

After a UM hunt group has been created, the configured settings can't be changed. If you want to change a configuration setting such as the pilot identifier on a UM hunt group, you must delete the existing UM hunt group and create a new UM hunt group that has the correct settings.

For additional tasks related to UM hunt groups, see [UM hunt group procedures](um-hunt-group-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to view the properties of a UM hunt group

This example displays all the UM hunt groups in the Active Directory forest.

```powershell
Get-UMHuntGroup
```

This example displays the details of a UM hunt group named `MyUMHuntGroup` in a formatted list.

```powershell
Get-UMHuntGroup -identity MyUMIPGateway\MyUMHuntGroup | Format-List
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you're using the **Get-UMHuntGroup** cmdlet, you can't enter only the name of the UM hunt group. You must also include the name of the UM IP gateway that's associated with the UM hunt group.
