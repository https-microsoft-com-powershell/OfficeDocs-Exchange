# Configure the limit on personal greetings for Outlook Voice Access users in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

The **Limit on personal greetings (minutes)** setting enables you to enter the maximum number of minutes that users associated with the Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy can use to record their voice mail greetings. This setting applies to both their standard voice mail and their Out of Office voice mail greetings. By default, the maximum greeting duration is set to 5 minutes. However, you can configure the maximum greeting duration to any setting between 1 and 10 minutes.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
