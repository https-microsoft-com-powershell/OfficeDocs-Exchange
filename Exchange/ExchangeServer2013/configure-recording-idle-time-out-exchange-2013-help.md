# Configure the recording idle time-out value in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can specify the number of seconds of silence that the system allows when a voice message is being recorded before the call is ended. For most organizations, this value should be set to the default of 5 seconds.

This value can be set from 2 through 10. Setting this value too low can cause the system to disconnect callers before they've finished leaving their voice messages. Setting this value too high allows lengthy silences in voice messages.

For additional management tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures in Exchange Server](um-dial-plan-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?
