# Create a Send connector for email sent to the Internet

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

By default, Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 doesn't allow you to send mail outside of your domain. To send mail outside your domain, you need to create a Send connector. The following graphic illustrates mail flow when you create a Send connector to send mail to the Internet.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Send connectors" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](mail-flow-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- See [Deploy a new installation of Exchange 2013](deploy-a-new-installation-of-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help.md) if you are beginning your installation. After the installation you can use the steps in this topic to create your outbound connector.

## Use the EAC to create a send connector for email sent to the Internet

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Mail flow** \> **Send connectors**, and then click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon").

2. In the **New send connector** wizard, specify a name for the send connector and then select **Internet** for the **Type**. Click **Next**.

3. Verify that **MX record associated with recipient domain** is selected, which specifies that the connector uses the domain name system (DNS) to route mail. Click **Next**.

4. Under **Address space**, click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon"). In the **Add domain** window, make sure SMTP is listed as the **Type**. For **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**, enter \*, which indicates that this send connector applies to messages addressed to any domain. Click **Save**.

5. Make sure **Scoped send connector** is not selected and then click **Next**.

6. For **Source server**, click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon"). In the **Select a server** window, select a Mailbox server that will be used to send mail to the Internet via the Client Access server and click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon"). After you've selected the server, click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon"). Click **OK**.

7. Click **Finish**.

Once you have created the Send connector, it appears in the Send connector list.

## Use the Shell to route mail through the Client Access server

In Exchange 2013 you can use the *FrontendProxyEnabled* parameter of the **Set-SendConnector** cmdlet to route outbound messages through the Client Access server. This parameter is not set to `$true` by default, but in many cases it can consolidate and simplify mail flow, especially if you are working with an environment with a large number of messaging servers.

This example sets the *FrontendProxyEnabled* parameter to `$true` on a Send connector.

```powershell
Set-SendConnector "Contoso.com Send Connector" -FrontendProxyEnabled $true
```

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully created a Send Connector for email sent to the Internet, send mail from one of your users to an outside recipient and verify that the message arrives successfully.
