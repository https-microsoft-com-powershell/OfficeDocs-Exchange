Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS) is running in 32-bit mode on this 64-bit computer.

Exchange 2007 requires that IIS be in full 64-bit mode when it runs on a 64-bit computer.

To resolve this issue, switch IIS to 64-bit mode, and then rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.

**To switch IIS to 64-bit mode**

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Type the following:

    **cscript c:\\inetpub\\adminscripts\\adsutil.vbs SET /w3svc/AppPools/Enable32BitAppOnWin64 False**

3. Press enter
