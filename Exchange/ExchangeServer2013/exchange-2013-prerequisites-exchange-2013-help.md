# Exchange 2013 prerequisites

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

This topic provides the steps for installing the necessary Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) operating system prerequisites for the Microsoft Exchange 2013 Mailbox, Client Access, and Edge Transport server roles. It also provides the prerequisites required to install the Exchange 2013 management tools on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7 client computers.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- The information in this topic is applicable to Service Pack 1 and later versions of Exchange 2013.

- The Edge Transport server role is available starting with Exchange 2013 SP1.

- Make sure that the functional level of your forest is at least Windows Server 2003, and that the schema master is running Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 2 or later. For more information about the Windows functional level, see [Managing Domains and Forests](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754918(v=ws.10)).

- The full installation option of Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 must be used for all servers running Exchange 2013 server roles or management tools.

- You must first join the computer to the appropriate internal Active Directory forest and domain.

- Some prerequisites require you to reboot the server to complete installation.

  - Install the latest Windows updates on your computer. For more information, see [Deployment security checklist](deployment-security-checklist-exchange-2013-help.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're installing the Mailbox server role and you intend for the server to be a member of a database availability group (DAG), you must be running Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter Edition, Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter Edition, or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Enterprise Edition. Windows Server 2008 R2 SP 1 Standard Edition doesn't support the features needed for DAGs.<BR>You can't upgrade Windows when Exchange is installed on the server.<BR>To upgrade to Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 4.0, you must first uninstall any previous versions of UCMA that are installed by using <STRONG>Add/Remove programs</STRONG>.
