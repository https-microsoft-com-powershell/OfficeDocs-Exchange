# Disable Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) for users in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable or disable Message Waiting Indicator for users associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. Message Waiting Indicator is a feature found in most legacy voice mail systems. In its most common form, it lights a lamp on a voice mail subscriber's phone to indicate the presence of a new voice mail message. Message Waiting Indicator can also send a text message to a UM-enabled user's mobile phone. The default setting is enabled.

If Message Waiting Indicator is disabled on the UM IP gateway, the feature isn't available to UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
