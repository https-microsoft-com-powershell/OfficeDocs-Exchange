Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because this server does not appear to belong to a valid Active Directory® directory service site.

Microsoft Exchange setup requires that the server that is used for installation of Exchange 2007 belong to a valid Active Directory site.

To resolve this issue, verify that the local server is a member of a valid Active Directory site and rerun Exchange Server 2007 setup.

You can use the **/DsGetSite** option of the Nltest.exe command line tool to verify and display site membership. For more information, see "Nltest.exe: NLTest Overview" in the "Tools and Settings Collection" of [Windows Server 2003 Technical Reference](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc758478(v=ws.10)).
