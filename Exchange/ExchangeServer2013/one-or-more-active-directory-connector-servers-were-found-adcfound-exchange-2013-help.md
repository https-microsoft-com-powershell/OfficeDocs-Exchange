# One or more Active Directory Connector servers were found\_ADCFound

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Exchange Server 2010 setup cannot continue because one or more Active Directory Connectors (ADC) have been found in the current Microsoft Exchange environment.

ADC replicates objects from Exchange Server version 5.5 to the Active Directory directory service in a mixed mode Microsoft Exchange environment and is not supported by Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010.

Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 setup requires that all ADC components be removed.

To resolve this issue, remove all ADC components, and rerun Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 setup.
