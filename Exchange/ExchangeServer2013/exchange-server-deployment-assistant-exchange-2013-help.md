# Exchange Server Deployment Assistant

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The Exchange Server Deployment Assistant is a Web-based tool that can help you with your Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2013 deployment. The Deployment Assistant asks you a few questions about your current environment and then generates a custom checklist and procedures that help simplify your deployment. To access the Deployment Assistant, see [Exchange Deployment Assistant](https://assistants.microsoft.com/).

You can use the Deployment Assistant for the following deployment scenarios:

- **Exchange 2016 On-Premises only**

  - New installation of Exchange Server 2016

  - Upgrade from Exchange Server 2010 to Exchange 2016

  - Upgrade from Exchange Server 2013 to Exchange 2016 *(coming soon)*

  - Upgrade from a mixed Exchange Server 2010 and Exchange Server 2013 organization to Exchange 2016 *(coming soon)*

    For more information about this scenario, see [Planning and deployment](planning-and-deployment-for-exchange-2013-installation-instructions.md).

- **Exchange 2016 Hybrid (On-Premises + Exchange Online)**

    Scenarios supporting Exchange 2016 hybrid deployments will be available soon\!

- **Exchange 2013 On-Premises only**

  - New installation of Exchange Server 2013

  - Upgrade from Exchange Server 2010 to Exchange 2013

  - Upgrade from Exchange Server 2007 to Exchange 2013

  - Upgrade from a mixed Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 organization to Exchange 2013

    For more information about this scenario, see [Planning and deployment](planning-and-deployment-for-exchange-2013-installation-instructions.md).

- **Exchange 2013 Hybrid (On-Premises + Exchange Online)**

  - Exchange 2013 on-premises with Exchange Online

  - Exchange 2010 on-premises with Exchange Online

  - Exchange 2007 on-premises with Exchange Online

    For more information about this scenario, see [Exchange Server Hybrid Deployments](../ExchangeHybrid/exchange-hybrid.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you have an Exchange 2003 on-premises organization and want to configure a new hybrid deployment with Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you must add one or more servers running Exchange 2010 Server Service Pack 3, not Exchange 2013 servers, to your on-premises organization. To do that, we strongly recommend that you use the Exchange 2010 hybrid deployment option in the <A href="https://assistants.microsoft.com/2010">Exchange Server Deployment Assistant</A>.

In addition to the above Exchange 2013 deployment scenarios, the Deployment Assistant also has deployment scenarios for Exchange 2010.
