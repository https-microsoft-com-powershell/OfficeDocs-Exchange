# Databases role

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The `Databases` management role enables administrators to create, manage, mount, and dismount mailbox databases on individual servers.

## Additional scope considerations

The **Move-DatabasePath** cmdlet, which is included with this role, requires that the database you want to configure must be within the database scope and the database must reside on a server that's within the server scope.

Also, the **Remove-MailboxDatabase** cmdlet, which is also included with this role, requires that the database you want to remove must either be within the database scope or the database must reside on a server that's within the server scope. This means you control who can remove mailbox databases using either database or server scopes.

For more information, see [Understanding management role scopes](understanding-management-role-scopes-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Default Management Role Assignments

This role has role assignments to one or more role assignees. The following table indicates whether the role assignment is regular or delegating, and also indicates the management scopes applied to each assignment. The following list describes each column:

  - **Regular assignment**: Regular role assignments enable the role assignee to access the permissions provided by the management role entries on this role.

  - **Delegating assignment**: Delegating role assignments give the role assignee the ability to assign this role to role groups, users, or USGs.

  - **Recipient read scope**: The recipient read scope determines what recipient objects the role assignee is allowed to read from Active Directory.

  - **Recipient write scope**: The recipient write scope determines what recipient objects the role assignee is allowed to modify in Active Directory.

  - **Configuration read scope**: The configuration read scope determines what configuration and server objects the role assignee is allowed to read from Active Directory.

  - **Configuration write scope**: The configuration write scope determines what organizational and server objects the role assignee is allowed to modify in Active Directory.
