_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the attempted domain preparation failed.

Exchange setup requires that the Active Directory directory service be modified for Exchange Server 2007 before domains in the Active Directory can be prepared.

The account being used to run the **setup /PrepareAD** command has insufficient permissions to execute this command even though it appears to belong to the Enterprise Admins group. The account may have expired.

To resolve this issue, verify that the logged-on user account is valid and belongs to the Enterprise Admins group, or log on with an account that has those permissions and rerun **setup /PrepareAD**.

For more information about how to perform the PrepareAD process, see "How to Prepare Active Directory and Domains" ([https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb125224(v=exchg.80)](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb125224(v=exchg.80))).
