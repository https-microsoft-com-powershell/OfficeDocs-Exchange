# Include text with the email message sent when a user Is enabled for voice mail in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When a user's mailbox is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) voice mail, an email message is sent that welcomes the user to Unified Messaging. This message contains the PIN information the user will use to first access the voice mail system.

You can customize the text that's sent in the welcome email message by adding text in the **When a user is enabled for Unified Messaging** box on a UM mailbox policy. You can include such information as the UM technical support telephone numbers or additional Outlook Voice Access numbers. After you add the text, it will be included in the email message sent when users associated with the UM mailbox policy are enabled for Unified Messaging.

> [!NOTE]
> The custom text you add to the welcome message is limited to 512 characters, and it can include simple HTML text.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to customize the text sent when a mailbox is enabled for Unified Messaging

This example enables UM-enabled users who are associated with a UM mailbox policy to receive additional instructions about UM and the Outlook Voice Access number that they can use to access their mailbox over a phone.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -UMEnabledText "You've been enabled for Unified Messaging voice mail. To access your Exchange mailbox, call your internal telephone extension number. From outside your office, call 425-555-1234."
```
