Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the Unified Messaging server role upgrade failed.

Exchange setup requires that all Unified Messaging server role language packs, except the US English language pack, be uninstalled before the Unified Messaging server role upgrade can continue.

Unified Messaging (UM) language packs that are included with Exchange 2007 contain pre-recorded prompts, Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion support for a given language.

Exchange 2007 UM language packs enable callers and Outlook Voice Access users to interact with the Unified Messaging system in multiple languages.

The existing non-US English language packs need to be uninstalled so that new language packs can be installed.

To resolve this issue, uninstall all Unified Messaging server role language packs, except the US English language pack, and then rerun Exchange 2007 setup.

For more information about uninstalling Unified Messaging server role language packs, see [How to Remove a Unified Messaging Language Pack from a Unified Messaging Server](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb124004(v=exchg.80)) in the Exchange 2007 product documentation.
