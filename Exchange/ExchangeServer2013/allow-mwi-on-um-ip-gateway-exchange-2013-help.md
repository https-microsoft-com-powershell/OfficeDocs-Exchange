# Allow Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) on a UM IP gateway in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can allow or prevent voice mail notifications to users for calls received by a Unified Messaging (UM) IP gateway. If you enable this setting, the UM IP gateway can receive and send SIP NOTIFY messages for users. Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) is enabled by default and allows message waiting notifications to be sent to users, but you can turn it off depending on your needs.

A message waiting indicator notifies a user about a new or unheard voice message. It appears in the Inbox in clients such as Outlook and Outlook Web App. It can also be a text (SMS) message sent to a registered mobile phone, an outgoing call made from an Exchange server to a number that's been configured for playing new messages, or a lighted lamp on a user's desktop phone.

> [!TIP]
> MWI notifications can also be enabled and disabled on a UM mailbox policy for a group of users.

For additional management tasks related to UM IP gateways, see [UM IP gateway procedures](um-ip-gateway-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
