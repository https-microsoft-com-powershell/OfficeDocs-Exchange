# Change the settings of an address book policy in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

After you create an address book policy (ABP), you can view or modify the name and the assigned global address list (GAL), offline address book (OAB), room list, and address lists.

For additional management tasks related to ABPs, see [Address book policy procedures](address-book-policy-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estmated time to complete: Less than 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address book policies" entry in the [Email address and address book permissions](email-address-and-address-book-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- Creating an ABP for an organization is a multi-step process that requires planning. For more information, see [Scenario: Deploying address book policies](scenario-deploying-address-book-policies-exchange-2013-help.md).

- You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to configure ABPs. You must use the Shell.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

- Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).

## Change the OAB, room list, and GAL for an ABP
<a name="UseShell"> </a>

This example changes the OAB, room list, and GAL that will be used by mailbox users who are assigned the ABP named All Fabrikam ABP.

```powershell
Set-AddressBookPolicy -Identity "All Fabrikam ABP" -OfflineAddressBook \Fabrikam-OAB-2 -GlobalAddressList "\All Fabrikam GAL" -RoomList "\All Fabrikam Rooms"
```

## Replace address lists in an ABP
<a name="UseShell"> </a>

The address lists that you specify for an existing ABP replace all address lists in the ABP.

This example replaces the existing address lists with the address lists named GovernmentAgencyA-Atlanta and GovernmentAgencyA-Moscow for the ABP named Government Agency A.

```powershell
Set-AddressBookPolicy -Identity "Government Agency A" -AddressLists "GovernmentAgencyA-Atlanta","GovernmentAgencyA-Moscow"
```

## Add address lists to an ABP
<a name="UseShell"> </a>

To preserve address lists that are already defined in an ABP, you need to specify those address lists when you add new ones to the ABP.

This example adds the address list named Contoso-Chicago to the ABP named ABP Contoso, which is already configured to use the address list named Contoso-Seattle.

```powershell
Set-AddressBookPolicy -Identity "ABP Contoso" -AddressLists "Contoso-Chicago","Contoso-Seattle"
```

## Remove address lists from an ABP
<a name="UseShell"> </a>

To remove existing address lists that are already defined in an ABP, you need to specify the address lists that you want to keep.

For example, the ABP named ABP Fabrikam uses the address lists named Fabrikam-HR and Fabrikam-Finance. To remove the Fabrikam-HR address list from the ABP, specify the Fabrikam-Finance address list that you want to keep.

```powershell
Set-AddressBookPolicy -Identity "ABP Fabrikam" -AddressLists Fabrikam-Finance
```
