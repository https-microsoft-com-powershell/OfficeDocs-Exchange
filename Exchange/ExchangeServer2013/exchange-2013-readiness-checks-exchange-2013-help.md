# Exchange 2013 readiness checks

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The topics in this section provide details about the readiness checks Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 is performing when Exchange is installed. Readiness checks ensure that your Active Directory forest and Exchange servers are ready for Exchange 2013. Each readiness check topic describes the actions that you can take to resolve issues that are found when the readiness checks are run. You should only perform the steps outlined in a readiness check topic if that readiness check was displayed during setup.

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
