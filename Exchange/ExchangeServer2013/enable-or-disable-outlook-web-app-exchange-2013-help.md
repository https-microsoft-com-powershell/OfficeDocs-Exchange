# Enable or disable Outlook Web App for a mailbox in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use the EAC or the Shell to enable or disable Outlook Web App for a user mailbox. When Outlook Web App is enabled, a user can use Outlook Web App to send and receive email. When Outlook Web App is disabled, the mailbox will continue to receive email messages, and a user can access it to send and receive email by using a MAPI client, such as Microsoft Outlook, or with a POP or IMAP email client, assuming that the mailbox is enabled to support access by those clients.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Outlook Web App and MAPI, POP3, and IMAP4 email clients is enabled by default when a user mailbox is created.

For additional management tasks related to managing email client access to a mailbox, see the following topics:

- [Enable or disable MAPI for a mailbox](enable-or-disable-mapi-exchange-2013-help.md)

- [Enable or disable IMAP4 access for a user](enable-or-disable-imap4-access-for-a-user-exchange-2013-help.md)

- [Enable or disable POP3 access for a user](enable-or-disable-pop3-access-for-a-user-exchange-2013-help.md)

3. On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.

4. Under **Email Connectivity**, do one of the following:

   - To disable Outlook Web App, under **Outlook Web App: Enabled**, click **Disable**.

     A warning appears asking if you're sure you want to disable Outlook Web App. Click **Yes**.

   - To enable Outlook Web App, under **Outlook Web App: Disabled**, click **Enable**.

## Use the Shell to enable or disable Outlook Web App

This example disables Outlook Web App for the mailbox of Yan Li.

```powershell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Yan Li" -OWAEnabled $false
```

This example enables Outlook Web App for the mailbox of Elly Nkya.

```powershell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity Ellyn@contoso.com -OWAEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-casmailbox).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled Outlook Web App for a user mailbox, do one of the following:

- In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**, click the mailbox, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

- On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.

- Under **Email Connectivity**, verify whether Outlook Web App is enabled or disabled.

Or

- Run the following command in the Shell.
