## Add members to a role group

To give a user the permissions that are granted by a role group, you need to add the user, or a universal security group (USG), or another role group that the user is a member of, as a member of the role group.

## Use the EAC to add members to a role group

1. In the Exchange admin center (EAC), navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2. Select the role group you want to add members to, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3. In the **Members** section, click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/JJ218640.c1e75329-d6d7-4073-a27d-498590bbb558(EXCHG.150).gif "Add Icon").

4. Select the users, USGs, or other role groups you want to add to the role group, click **Add**, and then click **OK**.

5. Click **Save** to save the changes to the role group.

## Use the Shell to add members to a role group

To add a role group member, see the [Examples](/powershell/module/exchange/Add-RoleGroupMember#examples) section in [Add-RoleGroupMember](/powershell/module/exchange/Add-RoleGroupMember).

To add multiple role group members or to replace the role group membership entirely, see the [Examples](/powershell/module/exchange/Update-RoleGroupMember#examples) section in [Update-RoleGroupMember](/powershell/module/exchange/Update-RoleGroupMember).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully added one or more members to a role group, do the following:

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2. Select the role group you added members to.

3. In the role group details pane, verify that the members you added are listed.

## Remove members from a role group

To remove the permissions granted by a role group from a user, you need to remove the user, or the universal security group (USG) the user is a member of, from the role group's membership.

## Use the EAC to remove members from a role group

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2. Select the role group you want to remove members from, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3. In the **Members** section, select the members you want to remove, click **Remove** ![Remove icon](images/Dd362328.479b6ced-8d64-4277-a725-f17fea202b28(EXCHG.150).gif "Remove icon"), and then click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to remove members from a role group

To remove a role group member, see the [Examples](/powershell/module/exchange/Remove-RoleGroupMember#examples) section in [Remove-RoleGroupMember](/powershell/module/exchange/Remove-RoleGroupMember).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully removed one or more members to a role group, do the following:

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2. Select the role group you removed members from.

3. In the role group details pane, verify that the members you removed are no longer listed.

## View the members of a role group

The members of a role group are granted the permissions provided by the management roles assigned to the role group. You can view the members of a role group to see which users, universal security groups (USG), or other role groups are granted permissions by the role group you specify.

## Use the EAC to view the members of a role group

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Permissions** \> **Admin Roles**.

2. Select the role group you want to view the members of.

3. In the role group details pane, view the members in the role group details pane.
