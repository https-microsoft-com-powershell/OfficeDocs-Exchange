# Create a Retention Policy in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

In Exchange Server 2013, you can use retention policies to manage email lifecycle. Retention policies are applied by creating retention tags, adding them to a retention policy, and applying the policy to mailbox users.

For additional management tasks related to retention policies, see [Messaging Records Management Procedures](messaging-records-management-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this task: 30 minutes.

- Procedures in this topic require specific permissions. See each procedure for its permissions information.

- Mailboxes to which you apply retention policies must reside on Exchange Server 2010 or later servers.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

## Step 1: Create a retention tag

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Messaging records management" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

### Use the EAC to create a retention tag

1. Navigate to **Compliance management** \> **Retention tags**, and then click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif)

2. Select one of the following options:

   - **Applied automatically to entire mailbox (default)**: Select this option to create a default policy tag (DPT). You can use DPTs to create a default deletion policy and a default archive policy, which applies to all items in the mailbox.

     > [!NOTE]
     > You can't use the EAC to create a DPT to delete voice mail items. For details about how to create a DPT to delete voice mail items, see the Shell example below.

   - **Applied automatically to a specific folder**: Select this option to create a retention policy tag (RPT) for a default folder such as **Inbox** or **Deleted Items**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > You can only create RPTs with the **Delete and allow recovery** or **Permanently delete** actions.

   - **Applied by users to items and folders (Personal)**: Select this option to create personal tags. These tags allow Outlook and Outlook Web App users to apply archive or deletion settings to a message or folders that are different from the settings applied to the parent folder or the entire mailbox.

3. The **New retention tag** page title and options will vary depending on the type of tag you selected. Complete the following fields:

   - **Name**: Enter a name for the retention tag. The tag name is for display purposes and doesn't have any impact on the folder or item a tag is applied to. Consider that the personal tags you provision for users are available in Outlook and Outlook Web App.

   - **Apply this tag to the following default folder**: This option is available only if you selected **Applied automatically to a specific folder**.

   - **Retention action**: Select one of the following actions to be taken after the item reaches its retention period:

   - **Delete and Allow Recovery**: Select this action to delete items but allow users to recover them using the **Recover Deleted Items** option in Outlook or Outlook Web App. Items are retained until the deleted item retention period configured for the mailbox database or the mailbox user is reached.

   - **Permanently Delete**: Select this option to permanently delete the item from the mailbox database.

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Mailboxes or items subject to In-Place Hold or litigation hold will be retained and returned in In-Place eDiscovery searches. To learn more, see [In-Place Hold and Litigation Hold](in-place-and-litigation-holds-exchange-2013-help.md).

   - **Move to Archive**: This action is available only if you're creating a DPT or a personal tag. Select this action to move items to the user's In-Place Archive.

   - **Retention period**: Select one of the following options:

   - **Never**: Select this option to specify that items should never be deleted or moved to the archive.

   - **When the item reaches the following age (in days)**: Select this option and specify the number of days to retain items before they're moved or deleted. The retention age for all supported items except Calendar and Tasks is calculated from the date an item is received or created. Retention age for Calendar and Tasks items is calculated from the end date.

   - **Comment**: User this optional field to enter any administrative notes or comments. The field isn't displayed to users.

### Use the Shell to create a retention tag

Use the **New-RetentionPolicyTag** cmdlet to create a retention tag. Different options available in the cmdlet allow you to create different types of retention tags. Use the _Type_ parameter to create a DPT ( `All`), RPT (specify a default folder type, such as `Inbox`) or a personal tag (`Personal`).

This example creates a DPT to delete all messages in the mailbox after 7 years (2,556 days).

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicyTag -Name "DPT-Corp-Delete" -Type All -AgeLimitForRetention 2556 -RetentionAction DeleteAndAllowRecovery
```

This example creates a DPT to move all messages to the In-Place Archive in 2 years (730 days).

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicyTag -Name "DPT-Corp-Move" -Type All -AgeLimitForRetention 730 -RetentionAction MoveToArchive
```

This example creates a DPT to delete voice mail messages after 20 days.

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicyTag -Name "DPT-Corp-Voicemail" -Type All -MessageClass Voicemail -AgeLimitForRetention 20 -RetentionAction DeleteAndAllowRecovery
```

This example creates a RPT to permanently delete messages in the Junk EMail folder after 30 days.

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicyTag -Name "RPT-Corp-JunkMail" -Type JunkEmail -AgeLimitForRetention 30 -RetentionAction PermanentlyDelete
```

This example creates a personal tag to never delete a message.

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicyTag -Name "Never Delete" -Type Personal -RetentionAction DeleteAndAllowRecovery -RetentionEnabled $false
```

## Step 2: Create a retention policy

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Messaging records management" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

### Use the EAC to create a retention policy

1. Navigate to **Compliance management** \> **Retention policies**, and then click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif)

2. In **New Retention Policy**, complete the following fields:

   - **Name**: Enter a name for the retention policy.

   - **Retention tags**: Click **Add** ![Add Icon](images/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif) to select the tags you want to add to this retention policy.

     A retention policy can contain the following tags:

   - One DPT with the **Move to Archive** action

   - One DPT with the **Delete and Allow Recovery** or **Permanently Delete** actions

   - One DPT for voice mail messages with the **Delete and Allow Recovery** or **Permanently Delete** actions

   - One RPT per default folder such as **Inbox** to delete items

   - Any number of personal tags

     > [!NOTE]
     > Although you can add any number of personal tags to a retention policy, having many personal tags with different retention settings can confuse users. We recommend linking no more than ten personal tags to a retention policy.

     You can create a retention policy without adding any retention tags to it, but items in the mailbox to which the policy is applied won't be moved or deleted. You can also add and remove retention tags from a retention policy after it's created.

### Use the Shell to create a retention policy

This example creates the retention policy RetentionPolicy-Corp and uses the _RetentionPolicyTagLinks_ parameter to associate five tags to the policy.

```powershell
New-RetentionPolicy "RetentionPolicy-Corp" -RetentionPolicyTagLinks "DPT-Corp-Delete","DPT-Corp-Move","DPT-Corp-Voicemail","RPT-Corp-JunkMail","Never Delete"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-RetentionPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-retentionpolicy).

## Step 3: Apply a retention policy to mailbox users

After you create a retention policy, you must apply it to mailbox users. You can apply different retention policies to different set of users. For detailed instructions, see [Apply a retention policy to mailboxes](apply-retention-policy-exchange-2013-help.md).

## How do you know this task worked?

After you create retention tags, add them to a retention policy, and apply the policy to a mailbox user, the next time the MRM mailbox assistant processes the mailbox, messages are moved or deleted based on settings you configured in the retention tags.

To verify that you have applied the retention policy, do the following:

1. Run the following Shell command to run the MRM assistant manually against a single mailbox.

   ```powershell
   Start-ManagedFolderAssistant -Identity <mailbox identity>
   ```

2. Log on to the mailbox using Outlook or Outlook Web App and verify that messages are deleted or moved to an archive in accordance with the policy configuration.
