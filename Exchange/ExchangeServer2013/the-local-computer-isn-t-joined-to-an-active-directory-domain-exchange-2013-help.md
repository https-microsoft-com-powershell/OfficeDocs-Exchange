# The local computer isn't joined to an Active Directory domain

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can't continue because it detected that the local computer isn't a member of an Active Directory domain. You must join the local computer to an Active Directory domain before you can install Exchange Server 2013. You may also see this message if you log into a local user account on the computer instead of a domain user account with sufficient administrative rights to install Exchange 2013.

For more information, see [Exchange 2013 system requirements](exchange-2013-system-requirements-exchange-2013-help.md).

Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
