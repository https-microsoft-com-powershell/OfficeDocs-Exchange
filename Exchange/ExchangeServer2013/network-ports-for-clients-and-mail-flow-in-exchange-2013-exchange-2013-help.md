# Network ports for clients and mail flow in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

This topic provides information about the network ports that are used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 for communication with email clients, Internet mail servers, and other services that are external to your local Exchange organization. Before we get into that, understand the following ground rules:

- We do not support restricting or altering network traffic between internal Exchange servers, between internal Exchange servers and internal Lync or Skype for Business servers, or between internal Exchange servers and internal Active Directory domain controllers in any and all types of topologies. If you have firewalls or network devices that could potentially restrict or alter this kind of network traffic, you need to configure rules that allow free and unrestricted communication between these servers (rules that allow incoming and outgoing network traffic on any port (including random RPC ports) and any protocol that never alter bits on the wire).

- Edge Transport servers are almost always located in a perimeter network, so it's expected that you'll restrict network traffic between the Edge Transport server and the Internet, and between the Edge Transport server and your internal Exchange organization. These network ports are described in this topic.

- It's expected that you'll restrict network traffic between external clients and services and your internal Exchange organization. It's also OK if you decide to restrict network traffic between internal clients and internal Exchange servers. These network ports are described in this topic.

## Network ports required for clients and services

The network ports that are required for email clients to access mailboxes and other services in the Exchange organization are described in the following diagram and table.

**Notes:**

- The destination for these clients and services is a Client Access server. This could be a standalone Client Access server or a Client Access server and Mailbox server installed on the same computer.

- Although the diagram shows clients and services from the Internet, the concepts are the same for internal clients (for example, clients in an accounts forest accessing Exchange servers in a resource forest). Similarly, the table doesn't have a source column because the source could be any location that's external to the Exchange organization (for example, the Internet or an accounts forest).

- Edge Transport servers have no involvement in the network traffic that's associated with these clients and services.

## Network ports required for mail flow

How mail is delivered to and from your Exchange organization depends on your Exchange topology. The most important factor is whether you have a subscribed Edge Transport server deployed in your perimeter network.

## Network ports required for mail flow (no Edge Transport servers)

The network ports that are required for mail flow in an Exchange organization that has only Client Access servers and Mailbox servers are described in the following diagram and table. Although the diagram shows separate Mailbox and Client Access servers, the concepts are the same whether the Client Access server and the Mailbox server are installed on the same computer or on separate computers.

## Network ports required for mail flow with Edge Transport servers

A subscribed Edge Transport server that's installed in your perimeter network basically eliminates SMTP mail flow through the Client Access server. Specifically:

- Outbound mail from the Exchange organization never flows through a Client Access server. Mail always flows from a Mailbox server in the subscribed Active Directory site to the Edge Transport server (regardless of the version of Exchange on the Edge Transport server).

- Inbound mail never flows through a standalone Client Access server. Mail flows from the Edge Transport server to a Mailbox server in the subscribed Active Directory site. If the Mailbox server and the Client Access server are installed on the same computer, mail from an Exchange 2013 Edge Transport server first arrives on the computer at the Front End Transport service (the Client Access server role) before it flows to the Transport service (the Mailbox server role). Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 Edge Transport servers always deliver mail directly to the Transport service even when the Mailbox server and the Client Access server are installed on the same computer.

For more information, see [Mail flow](mail-flow-exchange-2013-help.md).

The network ports that are required for mail flow in Exchange organizations that have Edge Transport servers are described in the following diagram and table. Unless otherwise noted, the concepts are the same whether the Client Access server and the Mailbox server are installed on the same computer or on separate computers.

## Name resolution

DNS resolution of the next mail hop is a fundamental part of mail flow in any Exchange organization. Exchange servers that are responsible for receiving inbound mail or delivering outbound mail must be able to resolve both internal and external host names for proper mail routing. And all internal Exchange servers must be able to resolve internal host names for proper mail routing. There are many different ways to design a DNS infrastructure, but the important result is to ensure name resolution for the next hop is working properly for all of your Exchange servers.

## Network ports required for hybrid deployments

The network ports that are required for an organization that uses both Exchange 2013 and Microsoft 365 or Office 365 are covered in the "Hybrid deployment protocols, port and endpoints" section in [Hybrid deployment prerequisites](../ExchangeHybrid/hybrid-deployment-prerequisites.md).

## Network ports required for Unified Messaging

The network ports that are required for Unified Messaging are covered in the following topics:

- [UM protocols, ports, and services](um-protocols-ports-and-services-exchange-2013-help.md)

- [Exchange Server 2013 SP1 Architecture Poster](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42542)
