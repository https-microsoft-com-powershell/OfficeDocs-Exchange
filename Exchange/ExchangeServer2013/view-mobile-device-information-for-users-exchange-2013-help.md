# View mobile device information for users

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Users can configure multiple mobile devices for synchronization with Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. You can use the EAC or the Shell to view a list of mobile devices that are associated with a specific user.

For additional management tasks related to mobile devices, see [Exchange ActiveSync](exchange-activesync-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mobile Device mailbox policy" entry in the [Clients and mobile devices permissions](clients-and-mobile-devices-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
