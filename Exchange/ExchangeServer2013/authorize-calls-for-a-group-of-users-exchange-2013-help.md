# Authorize calls for a group of users in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. You can use dialing authorizations on a mailbox policy to prohibit authenticated Outlook Voice Access users that are linked to the UM mailbox policy from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan. When you configure a setting on a UM mailbox policy, that setting applies to all UM-enabled users linked with the UM mailbox policy.

For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "UM mailbox policies" entry in the [Unified Messaging permissions](unified-messaging-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](create-um-mailbox-policy-exchange-2013-help.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that in-country/region and international dialing rules have been created on a UM dial plan. For detailed steps, see [Create dialing rules for users](create-dialing-rules-exchange-2013-help.md).
