# Change the audio codec in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

Unified Messaging can use one of four codecs for creating voice mail messages: MP3, Windows Media Audio (WMA), Group System Mobile (GSM) 06.10, and G.711 Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Linear. By default, when you create a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan, the UM dial plan uses the MP3 audio codec to record voice messages. The MP3 audio format is a popular audio format that is used across multiple operating systems, email clients, and MP3 players. After the UM dial plan is created, you can configure the UM dial plan to use one of the other audio formats including the WMA, GSM 06.10, or G.711 PCM Linear audio codecs. To listen to the voice message, a mobile phone or computer must have a compatible audio software application installed.

For additional tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures in Exchange Server](um-dial-plan-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
