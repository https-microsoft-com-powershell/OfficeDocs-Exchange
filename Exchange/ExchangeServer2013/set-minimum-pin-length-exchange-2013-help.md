# Set the minimum PIN length for voice mail in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can configure the minimum PIN length for your Outlook Voice Access users who are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM). The PIN settings that you configure on a UM mailbox policy will apply to all UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy.

Outlook Voice Access is used by UM-enabled users to access their voice mail, email, calendar, and personal contact information located in their mailbox. However, before they can access their mailbox, they must enter a PIN so they can be authenticated by the voice mail system.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the minimum PIN length value, existing Outlook Voice Access users will be prompted to enter a new PIN that contains the new minimum number of digits before they can continue. The default is 6.

For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to configure the minimum PIN length for Outlook Voice Access

This example sets the minimum PIN length to 8 digits for Outlook Voice Access users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -MinPINLength 8
```

This example sets the minimum PIN length to 8 digits and sets the number of times a sign-in can fail before the user's PIN is reset to 3. This applies to UM-enabled users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -LogonFailuresBeforePINReset 3 -MinPINLength 8
```
