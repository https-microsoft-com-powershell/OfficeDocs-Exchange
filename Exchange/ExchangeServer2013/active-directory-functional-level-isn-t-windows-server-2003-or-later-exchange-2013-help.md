# Active Directory functional level isn't Windows Server 2003 or later

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can't continue because it detected that the forest functional level of the current Active Directory forest isn't Windows Server 2003 native or later. Before you can install Exchange 2013, you must raise the forest functional level to Windows Server 2003 or later.

For information about how to raise the forest functional level of the current Active Directory forest to Windows Server 2003 or later, see [Raise the Forest Functional Level](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc730985(v=ws.11)).

For more information about Active Directory functional levels, see the following topics:
