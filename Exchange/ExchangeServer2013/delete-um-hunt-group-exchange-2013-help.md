# Delete a UM hunt group in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

After you delete a Unified Messaging (UM) hunt group, the UM IP gateway associated with the UM hunt group will no longer service or answer incoming calls. If deleting the UM hunt group leaves the UM IP gateway without any remaining configured hunt groups, the UM IP gateway can't handle or process UM calls.

For additional tasks related to UM hunt groups, see [UM hunt group procedures](um-hunt-group-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> If you want to change the UM hunt group settings, you must delete the hunt group and then create another hunt group that has the appropriate settings.
