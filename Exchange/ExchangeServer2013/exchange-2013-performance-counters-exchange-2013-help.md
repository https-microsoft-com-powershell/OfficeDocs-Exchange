</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Counter</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Threshold</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time</p></td>
<td><p>Shows the percentage of time that the processor is executing application or operating system processes. This is when the processor isn't idle.</p></td>
<td><p>Should be less than 75% on average.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Shows the ratio of Memory\Committed Bytes to the Memory\Commit Limit. Committed memory is the physical memory in use for which space has been reserved in the paging file should it need to be written to disk. The commit limit is determined by the size of the paging file. If the paging file is enlarged, the commit limit increases, and the ratio is reduced. This counter displays the current percentage value only; it isn't an average.</p></td>
