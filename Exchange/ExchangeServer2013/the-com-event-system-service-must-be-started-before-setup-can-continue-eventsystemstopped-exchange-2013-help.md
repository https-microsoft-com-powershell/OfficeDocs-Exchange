# The COM+ Event System Service must be started before setup can continue\_EventSystemStopped

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because its attempt to install the Client Access Server or Edge Transport server roles failed because the COM+ Event System service is not started on the target computer.

Exchange 2007 setup requires the computer that you are installing Microsoft Exchange to have the COM+ Event System service status set to **Started**.

The COM+ Event System service supports system event notification for COM+ components, which provide automatic distribution of events to subscribing COM components.

Both the Client Access Server and Edge Transport server roles have dependencies on COM+ components that subscribe to the COM+ Event System service.

To resolve this issue, verify that the COM+ Event System service status is set to **Started** on the local computer, and then rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.

**To set the status of the COM+ Event System service to 'Started'**

1. Right-click **My Computer**, and then click **Manage**.

2. Expand the **Services and Applications** node, and then click the **Services** node.

3. In the right pane, locate the **Com+ Event System**.

4. Right-click **Com+ Event System**, and then click **Properties**.

5. Set the **Startup Type** to **Automatic** and the **Service status** to **Started**.

6. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.
