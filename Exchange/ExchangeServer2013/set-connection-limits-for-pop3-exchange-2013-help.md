3. On the server properties page, click **POP3**.

4. Scroll down and click **More options**.

5. Under **Connection limits**, use the following settings:

   - **Maximum connections**: Specifies the total number of connections the specified server will accept. This includes authenticated and unauthenticated connections. The default value is 2,147,483,647. The possible values are from 1 through 2,147,483,647.

   - **Maximum connections from a single IP address**: Specifies the number of connections that the server will accept from a single IP address. The default value is 2,147,483,647. The possible values are from 1 through 2,147,483,647.

6. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK** to save your changes.

After you set connection limits, you must restart the POP3 services. For information about how to restart the POP3 services, see [Start and stop the POP3 services](start-and-stop-the-pop3-services-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to set POP3 connection limits for a server, an IP address, or a user

This example sets the connection limit for a server named CAS01.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -Server CAS01 -MaxConnections Value
```

This example sets the connection limit for an IP address to a server named CAS01.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -Server CAS01 -MaxConnectionsFromSingleIP Value
```

This example sets the connection limit for a user.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -MaxConnectionsPerUser Value
```

This example sets the maximum command size.

```powershell
Set-PopSettings -MaxCommandSize Value
```

After you set connection limits, you must restart the POP3 services. For information about how to restart the POP3 services, see [Start and stop the POP3 services](start-and-stop-the-pop3-services-exchange-2013-help.md).
