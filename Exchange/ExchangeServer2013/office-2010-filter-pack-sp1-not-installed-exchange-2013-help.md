# Office 2010 Filter Pack SP1 not installed

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You'll need to install this update before Exchange 2013 Setup can continue.

Exchange 2013 Setup requires that the Microsoft Office 2010 Filter Pack Service Pack 1 update be installed on the computer before installation can continue.

Download and install the 64-bit update from the following URL, and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2013 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.

[Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Office Filter Pack 2010 (KB2460041) 64-bit Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17062)
