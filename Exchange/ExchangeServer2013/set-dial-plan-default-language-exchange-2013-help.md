# Set the default language on a dial plan in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can set the default language for a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan. Each dial plan you create will initially use English (en-US) as the default language. The English (en-US) language pack is installed on all versions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and can't be removed.

If you want to select another language as the default language, for example, German (de-DE), you must first download the German UM language pack .exe file from [Exchange Server 2013 UM Language Packs](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35368) and install that language pack on the Mailbox server by using the UMLanguagePack.de-de.exe installation file. After you've installed the language pack, you can set the default language to a language other than English (en-US) on your UM dial plans.
