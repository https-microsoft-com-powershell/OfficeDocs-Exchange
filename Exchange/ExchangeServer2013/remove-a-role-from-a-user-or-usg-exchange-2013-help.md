# Remove a role from a user or USG

Management role assignments assign a management role to a user or universal security group (USG).

For more information about management role assignments in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, see [Understanding management role assignments](understanding-management-role-assignments-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Remove a management role assignment

If you know the name of the role assignment you want to remove, use the following syntax.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment <assignment name>
```

For example, to remove the "Tier 2 Help Desk Assignment" role assignment, use the following command.

```powershell
Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment "Tier 2 Help Desk Assignment"
```

If you don't know the name of the role assignment, you can use the following syntax.

```powershell
Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee <user or USG> -Role <role name> -Delegating <$true | $false> | Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment
```

For example, if you want to remove the Mail Recipients regular role assignment from the user davids, use the following command.

```powershell
Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee davids -Role "Mail Recipients" -Delegating $false | Remove-ManagementRoleAssignment
```
