Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Exchange Server 2010 setup cannot continue because the specified recipient policy uses an unsupported Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address format.

Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 setup requires that all SMTP addresses used for e-mail address policies not contain IP address literals, for example: *user@\[10.10.1.1\]*.

To resolve this issue, change the value of the SMTP address in the recipient policy so that it does not contain an IP address literal. Replace brackets (\[\]) and numbers (10.10.1.1) of the IP address literal with the Domain Name System (DNS) naming format, for example: *user@contoso.com*, and then rerun Exchange setup.
