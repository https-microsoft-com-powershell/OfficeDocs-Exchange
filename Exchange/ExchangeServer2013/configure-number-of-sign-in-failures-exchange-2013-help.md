# Configure the number of sign-in failures before Outlook Voice Access users are disconnected in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can specify the number of sequential unsuccessful sign-in attempts that are allowed before a caller is disconnected. The value of this setting can be from 1 through 20. Setting this value too low can frustrate users. For most organizations, this value should be set to the default of three attempts.

For additional management tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures in Exchange Server](um-dial-plan-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

## Use the EAC to configure the number of sign-in failures before users are disconnected

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**.

2. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM dial plan** page, click **Configure**.

4. In **Settings**, under **Number of sign-in failures before disconnecting**, enter the number of sign-in failures.

5. Click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to configure the number of sign-in failures before users are disconnected

This example sets the number of sign-in failures before users are disconnected to 5 for a UM dial plan named `MyUMDialPlan`.

```powershell
Set-UMDialPlan -identity MyUMDialPlan -LogonFailuresBeforeDisconnect 5
```
