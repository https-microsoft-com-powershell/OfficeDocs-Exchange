# Help Identify My Issue with Sending/Receiving Email on a Mobile Device (Automatic Checks)

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The check on this page will help identify some of the most common connectivity issues. You can use the automatic check below to validate your connectivity or help determine root cause.

You'll be asked to install an application on your machine and agree to the end user licensing agreement. Depending on the test, you'll be asked for a user account or domain name when the check runs.

## Prerequisites

We'll check to see if you have Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 installed. To obtain Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5, go to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653). See additional perquisite details [here](/connectivity-analyzer/microsoft-connectivity-analyzer-tool).
