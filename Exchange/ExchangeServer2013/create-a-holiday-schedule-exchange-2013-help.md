# Create a holiday schedule in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can define the dates and times your organization will be closed for holidays and other occasions. Between the start dates and the end dates you specify, callers who reach the Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant will hear a holiday greeting you specify when you configure the holiday schedule. After the caller hears the holiday greeting you've specified, the non-business hours greeting and menu prompts will be played for the caller.

You can also create a holiday schedule within an existing holiday schedule. When you create multiple holiday schedules, Unified Messaging lets you overlap your scheduled holiday times. For example, you can define a holiday schedule from December 15th through December 31st when your organization will be closed for construction, and you can define another holiday schedule from December 24th through December 26th. When callers call in to the auto attendant from December 15th through December 23rd and from December 27th through December 31st, they'll be presented with the holiday greeting that you've specified for this schedule. For example, "We are currently closed for construction." When callers call in to the auto attendant from December 24th through December 26th, they'll be presented with another holiday greeting, such as "We are currently closed for business so that our employees can enjoy the holidays with their families."

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to specify a holiday schedule for a UM auto attendant

This example configures a UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant` that has business hours configured to be 10:45 to 13:15 (Sunday), 09:00 to 17:00 (Monday), and 09:00 to 16:30 (Saturday), and holiday times and their associated greetings configured to be "New Year" on January 2, 2013, and "Building Closed for Construction" from April 24, 2013 through April 28, 2013.

```powershell
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -BusinessHoursSchedule 0.10:45-0.13:15,1.09:00-1.17:00,6.09:00-6.16:30 -HolidaySchedule "New Year,newyrgrt.wav,1/2/2013","Building Closed for Construction,construction.wav,4/24/2013,4/28/2013"
