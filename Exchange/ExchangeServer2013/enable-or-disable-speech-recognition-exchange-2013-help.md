# Enable or disable automatic speech recognition in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable your Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). After you speech-enable a UM auto attendant, callers can respond verbally to auto attendant prompts and move through the menu system of the auto attendant. By default, an auto attendant isn't speech-enabled when you create it. After you speech-enable the auto attendant, callers can use only voice commands to navigate the auto attendant menu system, and touchtone inputs can't be used.

Although it isn't required, we recommend that you configure a dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) fallback auto attendant for each speech-enabled auto attendant so callers can use touchtone inputs if the speech-enabled auto attendant doesn't recognize or understand the words they say. If a DTMF fallback auto attendant is configured, callers can use DTMF inputs, also known as touchtone inputs, to navigate the auto attendant menu system, spell a user's name, or use a custom menu prompt. We don't recommend that you speech-enable a DTMF fallback auto attendant.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
