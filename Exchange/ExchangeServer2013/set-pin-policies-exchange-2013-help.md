# Set Outlook Voice Access PIN policies in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can set PIN policies on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. UM mailbox policies can be configured to increase the level of security for UM-enabled users that use Outlook Voice Access by requiring users to comply with the predefined PIN policies for your organization.

To set PIN policies for Outlook Voice Access users, you can either create a new UM mailbox policy or modify an existing UM mailbox policy. After a new UM mailbox policy is created, you can then configure the UM mailbox policy by configuring the following PIN settings:

- `MinPasswordLength`

- `PINLifetime`

- `LogonFailuresBeforePINReset`

- `MaxLogonAttempts`

- `AllowCommonPatterns`

- `PINHistoryCount`

It's a security best practice to implement strong PIN requirements for UM users. This can be enforced by creating UM PIN policies that require 6 or more digits for PINs and increase the level of security for your network.

When you change the PIN policy, the new PIN setting is applied to users who are currently associated with the UM mailbox policy. For example, if you modify the UM mailbox policy and change the minimum PIN length from 7 to 10 digits, the next time users log on they'll be forced to change their PIN to comply with the changed PIN requirement.
