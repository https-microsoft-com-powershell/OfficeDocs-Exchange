# Set the number of previous voice mail PINs to recycle in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When Outlook Voice Access users dial in to an Outlook Voice Access number, they're prompted to enter their PIN so that the voice mail system can authenticate them. After they're authenticated, they can access the voice mail, email, calendaring, and personal contact information in their mailbox from any telephone.

Several PIN-related settings can be configured on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. The **PIN recycle count** setting specifies the number of unique PINs users must use before they can reuse an old PIN. You can set the value of this setting between 1 and 20. For most organizations, this value should be set to 5 PINs, which is the default. Setting this value too high can frustrate users because it can be difficult for users to create and memorize many PINs. Setting it too low may introduce a security threat to your network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PIN recycle count can't be disabled.

For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
