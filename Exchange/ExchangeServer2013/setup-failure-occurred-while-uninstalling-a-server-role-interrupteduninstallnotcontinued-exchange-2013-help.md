Exchange Server 2010 setup cannot continue because a previous setup failure occurred while uninstalling a server role.

Exchange 2010 setup requires that a failed server role uninstall be successfully uninstalled before any other setup task can continue.

To address this issue, uninstall the failed server role(s), and then rerun setup.

For more information about how to remove a server role, see the Exchange 2007 product documentation topic, [How to Remove Exchange 2007 Server Roles](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb124115(v=exchg.80)).
