# Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

Telephone user interface (TUI) settings are used when a user accesses the Unified Messaging (UM) system by using Outlook Voice Access. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI configuration settings, you modify properties and their values on the UM-enabled user's mailbox.

You can change the following TUI settings for a UM-enabled user:

- Allow subscriber access

- Allow TUI access to the calendar

- Allow TUI access to email

- Allow Automatic Speech Recognition

For additional management tasks related to UM users, see [Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user](set-mailbox-features-for-a-user-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "UM mailboxes" entry in the [Unified Messaging permissions](unified-messaging-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that the existing Exchange recipient is enabled for Unified Messaging and voice mail. For detailed steps, see [Enable a user for voice mail](enable-a-user-for-voice-mail-exchange-2013-help.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](create-um-dial-plan-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to modify a single UM-enabled user's TUI settings

This example enables calendar and email access using the TUI for a UM-enabled user named Tony Smith.

```powershell
Set-UMMailbox -Identity tony@contoso.com TUIAccessToCal True -TUIAccessToEmail True -OperatorNumber 111111 -DisableMissedCallNotification False -AnonCallBlock True
```

> [!NOTE]
> TUI settings for users are also available on UM mailbox policies. Modifying TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy affects all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. For more information about how to modify TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, see [Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users](set-mailbox-features-for-users-exchange-2013-help.md).
