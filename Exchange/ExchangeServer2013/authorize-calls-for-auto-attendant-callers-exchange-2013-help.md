# Authorize calls for auto attendant callers in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant. Dialing authorizations on an auto attendant are used to prohibit users who call in to the auto attendant from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging makes an outgoing call for a user after they've called into a phone number that is configured on a UM auto attendant.

For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
