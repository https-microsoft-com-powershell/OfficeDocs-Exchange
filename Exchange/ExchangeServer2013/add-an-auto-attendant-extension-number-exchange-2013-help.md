# Add an auto attendant extension number in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can configure an extension number or multiple extension numbers on a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant. When you add an extension number to a UM auto attendant, that number can be used by callers to call into the auto attendant. Also, you may have to add extension numbers because there is more than one extension number that callers can use to access an auto attendant. By default, no extension numbers are configured when you create an auto attendant.

You can create a new auto attendant without setting up an extension number for the auto attendant. You can also associate more than one telephone or extension number with a single auto attendant. You can either add the extension numbers when you create the UM auto attendant or add them after you configure the auto attendant. The number of digits in the extension number you configured on the UM auto attendant must match the number of digits for an extension number that's configured on the UM dial plan associated with the UM auto attendant.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also add a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) address instead of adding an extension number. A SIP address is used by some IP Private Branch eXchanges (PBXs) and Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Microsoft Lync Server.
