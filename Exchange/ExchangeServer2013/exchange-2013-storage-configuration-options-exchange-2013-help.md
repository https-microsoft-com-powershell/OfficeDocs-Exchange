# Exchange 2013 storage configuration options

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Understanding storage options and requirements for the Mailbox server role in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 is an important part of your Mailbox server storage design solution.

## Storage architectures

The following table describes supported storage architectures and provides best practice guidance for each type of storage architecture where appropriate.

A network-attached storage (NAS) unit is a self-contained computer connected to a network, with the sole purpose of supplying file-based data storage services to other devices on the network. The operating system and other software on the NAS unit provide the functionality of data storage, file systems, and access to files, and the management of these functionalities (for example, file storage).

All storage used by Exchange for storage of Exchange data must be block-level storage because Exchange 2013 doesn't support the use of NAS volumes, other than in the SMB 3.0 scenario outlined in the topic [Exchange 2013 virtualization](exchange-2013-virtualization-exchange-2013-help.md). Also, in a virtualized environment, NAS storage that's presented to the guest as block-level storage via the hypervisor isn't supported.

Using storage tiers is not recommended, as it could adversely affect system performance. For this reason, do not allow the storage controller to automatically move the most accessed files to "faster" storage.

The following table provides a list of supported physical disk types and provides best practice guidance for each physical disk type where appropriate.

## Factors to consider when choosing disk types

There are several trade-offs when choosing disk types for Exchange 2013 storage. The correct disk is one that balances performance (both sequential and random) with capacity, reliability, power utilization, and capital cost. The following table of supported physical disk types provides information to help you when considering these factors.

From a performance perspective, using large, slower disks for Exchange storage is okay, provided the disks can maintain an average read and write latency of 20ms or less under load.

## Best practices for supported storage configurations

This section provides best practice information about supported disk and array controller configurations.

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is often used to both improve the performance characteristics of individual disks (by striping data across several disks) as well as to provide protection from individual disk failures. With the advancements in Exchange 2013 high availability, RAID is not a required component for Exchange 2013 storage design. However, RAID is still an essential component of Exchange 2013 storage design for standalone servers as well as solutions that require storage fault tolerance.

**Operating System, System, or Pagefile Volume**

The recommended configuration for an operating system, system or pagefile volume is to utilize RAID technology to protect this data type. The recommended RAID configuration is either RAID-1 or RAID-1/0, however all RAID types are supported.

**Separated Mailbox Database and Log Volumes**

If you are deploying a standalone Mailbox server role architecture, RAID technology is required for the mailbox database and log volumes. The recommended RAID configuration for mailbox volumes is RAID-1/0 (especially if you are using 5.4K or 7.2K disks); however all RAID types are supported. For log volumes, RAID-1 or RAID-1/0 is the recommended RAID configuration.

When using RAID-5 or RAID-6 configurations for the operating system, pagefile, or Exchange data volumes, note the following:

- RAID-5 configurations, including variations such as RAID-50 and RAID-51, should have no more than 7 disks per array group and array controller high-priority scrubbing and surface scanning enabled.

- RAID-6 configurations should have array controller high-priority scrubbing and surface scanning enabled.

While JBOD is supported in high availability architectures that have 3 or more highly available database copies, because the log and mailbox database volumes are separated, JBOD is not recommended.

**Mailbox Database and Log Volume Co-Location**

Mailbox database and log volume co-location is not recommended in standalone architectures. In high availability architectures, there are two possibilities for this scenario:

1. Single database per volume

2. Multiple databases per volume

**Single Database Per Volume**

From an Exchange perspective, JBOD means having both the database and its associated logs stored on a single disk. To deploy on JBOD, you must deploy a minimum of three highly available database copies. Utilizing a single disk is a single point of failure, because when the disk fails, the database copy residing on that disk is lost. Having a minimum of three database copies ensures fault tolerance by having two additional copies in the event that one copy (or one disk) fails. However, placement of three highly available database copies, as well as the use of lagged database copies, can affect storage design. The following table shows guidelines for RAID or JBOD considerations.

### RAID or JBOD Considerations

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Primary datacenter servers</p></td>
<td><p>RAID</p></td>
<td><p>RAID or JBOD (2 copies)</p></td>

<td><p>RAID (1 copy)</p></td>
<td><p>RAID or JBOD</p></td>
<td><p>RAID</p></td>
<td><p>RAID or JBOD</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To deploy on JBOD with the primary datacenter servers, you need three or more highly available database copies within the DAG. If mixing lagged copies on the same server hosting highly available database copies (for example, not using dedicated lagged database copy servers), you need at least two lagged database copies.

For the secondary datacenter servers to use JBOD, you should have at least two highly available database copies in the secondary datacenter. The loss of a copy in the secondary datacenter won't result in requiring a reseed across the WAN or having a single point of failure in the event the secondary datacenter is activated. If mixing lagged database copies on the same server hosting highly available database copies (for example, not using dedicated lagged database copy servers), you need at least two lagged database copies.

For dedicated lagged database copy servers, you should have at least two lagged database copies within a datacenter to use JBOD. Otherwise, the loss of disk results in the loss of the lagged database copy, as well as the loss of the protection mechanism.

**Multiple Databases Per Volume**

Multiple databases per volume is a new JBOD scenario available in Exchange 2013 that allows for active and passive copies (including lagged copies) to be mixed on a single disk, enabling better disk utilization. However, to deploy lagged copies in this manner, automatic lagged copy log file play down must be enabled. The following table shows guidelines for JBOD considerations for multiple databases per volume.

<td><p>Server Message Block (SMB) 3.0</p></td>
<td><p>The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol (on top of TCP/IP or other network protocols) that allows applications on a computer to access files and resources on a remote server. It also allows applications to communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client request. Windows Server 2012 introduces the new 3.0 version of the SMB protocol with the following features:</p>

<td><p>Storage Spaces</p></td>
<td><p>Storage Spaces is a new storage solution that delivers virtualization capabilities for Windows Server 2012. Storage Spaces allow you to organize physical disks into storage pools, which can be easily expanded by simply adding disks. These disks can be connected either through USB, SATA or SAS. It also utilizes virtual disks (spaces), which behave just like physical disks, with associated powerful capabilities such as thin provisioning, as well as resiliency to failures of underlying physical media.

<td><p>Resilient File System (ReFS)</p></td>
<td><p>ReFS is a newly engineered file system for Windows Server 2012 that is built on the foundations of NTFS. ReFS maintains high degree of compatibility with NTFS while providing enhanced data verification and auto-correction techniques as well as an integrated end-to-end resiliency to corruptions especially when used in conjunction with the storage spaces feature. For more information on ReFS, see <a href="/windows-server/storage/refs/refs-overview">Resilient File System Overview</a>.</p></td>

<td><p>Data De-Duplication</p></td>
<td><p>Data deduplication is a new technique to optimize storage utilization for Windows Server 2012. It is a method of finding and removing duplication within data without compromising its fidelity or integrity. The goal is to store more data in less space by segmenting files into small variable-sized chunks, identifying duplicate chunks, and maintaining a single copy of each chunk. Redundant copies of the chunk are replaced by a reference to the single copy, the chunks are organized into container files, and the containers are compressed for further space optimization.</p></td>
<td><p>Not Supported for Exchange database files. Note: Can be used for Exchange database files that are completely offline (used as backups or archives).</p></td>
