# Configure email forwarding for a mailbox in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Email forwarding lets you to set up a mailbox to forward email messages sent to that mailbox to another user's mailbox in or outside of your organization.

If your organization uses an on-premises Exchange or hybrid Exchange environment, you should use the on-premises Exchange admin center (EAC) to create and manage shared mailboxes.

## Use the Exchange admin center to configure email forwarding

You can use the EAC set up email forwarding to a single internal recipient, a single external recipient (using a mail contact), or multiple recipients (using a distribution group).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" entry in the [Recipients Permissions](recipients-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. In the list of user mailboxes, click or tap the mailbox that you want to configure mail forwarding for, and then click or tap **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.

4. Under **Mail Flow**, select **View details** to view or change the setting for forwarding email messages.

    On this page, you can set the maximum number of recipients that the user can send a message to. For on-premises Exchange organizations, the recipient limit is unlimited.

5. Check the **Enable forwarding** check box, and then click or tap **Browse**.

6. On the **Select Recipient** page, select a user you want to forward all email to. Select the **Deliver message to both forwarding address and mailbox** check box if you want both the recipient and the forwarding email address to get copies of the emails sent. Click or tap **OK**, and then click or tap **Save**.

What if you want to forward mail to an address outside your organization? Or forward mail to multiple recipients? You can do that, too!

- **External addresses** Create a mail contact and then, in the steps above, select the mail contact on the **Select Recipient** page. Need to know how to create a mail contact? Check out [Manage mail contacts](manage-mail-contacts-exchange-2013-help.md).

- **Multiple recipients** Create a distribution group, add recipients to it, and then in the steps above, select the mail contact on the **Select Recipient** page. Need to know how to create a mail contact? Check out [Create and manage distribution groups](manage-distribution-groups-exchange-2013-help.md).

## How do you know this worked?

To make sure that you've successfully configured email forwarding, do one of the following:

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. In the list of user mailboxes, click or tap the mailbox that you configured email forwarding for, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the mailbox properties page, click or tap **Mailbox Features**.

4. Under **Mail Flow**, click or tap **View details** to view the mail forwarding settings.
