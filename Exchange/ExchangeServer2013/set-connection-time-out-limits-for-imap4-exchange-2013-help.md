## Use the EAC to set connection time-out limits for IMAP4

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Servers** **\>** **Servers**.

2. In the list of servers, select the Client Access server, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/JJ218640.6f53ccb2-1f13-4c02-bea0-30690e6ea71d(EXCHG.150).gif "Edit icon").

3. On the server properties page, click **IMAP4**.

4. Scroll down and click **More options**.

5. Under **Time-out settings**, use the following settings:

   - **Authenticated time-out (seconds)**:  Specifies the time to wait before closing an idle authenticated connection. The default value is 1,800. The possible values are from 30 through 86,400.

   - **Unauthenticated time-out (seconds)**: Specifies the time to wait before closing an idle connection that isn't authenticated. The default value is 60. The possible values are from 30 through 3,600.

6. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK** to save your changes.

After you've set the connection time-out limits for IMAP4, you must restart the IMAP4 services for the settings to take effect. For information about how to restart the IMAP4 services, see [Start and stop the IMAP4 services](start-and-stop-the-imap4-services-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to set connection time-out limits for IMAP4

This example sets the connection time-out limit for idle authenticated connections.

```powershell
Set -ImapSettings -Identity CAS01 -AuthenticatedConnectionTimeout TimeValue
```

This example sets the connection time-out limit for idle unauthenticated connections.

```powershell
Set -ImapSettings -Identity CAS01 -PreAuthenticatedConnectionTimeout TimeValue
```

After you've set the connection time-out limits for IMAP4, you must restart the IMAP4 services for the settings to take effect. For information about how to restart the IMAP4 services, see [Start and stop the IMAP4 services](start-and-stop-the-imap4-services-exchange-2013-help.md).

For more information about syntax and parameters, see [Set-ImapSettings](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-ImapSettings).
