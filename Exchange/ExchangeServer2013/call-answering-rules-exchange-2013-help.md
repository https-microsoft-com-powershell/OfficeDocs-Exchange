# Call answering rules in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can specify whether you want individual users to be able to create and manage their own call answering rules by configuring their mailbox properties. By default, they can create call answering rules.

You can enable or disable Call Answering Rules for multiple users that are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) by configuring Call Answering Rules on a UM dial plan or UM mailbox policy.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the EAC to configure this feature. You must use the Shell to enable or disable Call Answering Rules for a voice mail user.

For additional management tasks related to allowing users to forward calls, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
