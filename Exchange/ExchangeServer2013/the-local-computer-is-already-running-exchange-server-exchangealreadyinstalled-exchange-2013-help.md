Microsoft® Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the local computer has previous Microsoft Exchange components installed.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the local computer not have existing Microsoft Exchange components installed.

To resolve this issue, remove any Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server or Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 components, and then rerun Microsoft Exchange setup.

**To remove Microsoft Exchange components**

1. Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.

2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs**.

3. In the **Currently installed programs** list, click **Microsoft Exchange**, and then click **Change/Remove**.

4. In Microsoft Exchange Installation Wizard, click **Next**.

5. In the Action list on the Component Selection page, click the down arrow next to each component that has been installed, and then click **Remove**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Installed components have a check mark in the Action list. When you click <STRONG>Remove</STRONG>, the check mark is replaced by the word <STRONG>Remove</STRONG>.

6. Click **Next** two times.

7. Click **Finish**.
