# Disable voice mail for a user in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can disable Unified Messaging (UM) for a UM-enabled user. When you do this, the user can no longer use the voice mail features found in Unified Messaging. If you prefer, when you disable UM for a user, you can keep the UM settings for the user.

For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "UM mailboxes" entry in the [Unified Messaging permissions](unified-messaging-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](create-um-dial-plan-exchange-2013-help.md).

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](create-um-mailbox-policy-exchange-2013-help.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that the existing user is currently enabled for Unified Messaging. For detailed steps, see [Enable a user for voice mail](enable-a-user-for-voice-mail-exchange-2013-help.md).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
