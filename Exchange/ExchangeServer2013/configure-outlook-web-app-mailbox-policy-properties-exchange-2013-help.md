## Use the EAC to view or configure Outlook Web App mailbox policies

1. In the EAC, click **Permissions** \> **Outlook Web App policies**.

2. In the result pane, click to select the mailbox policy you want to view or configure.

3. Click the **Edit** button.

4. On the **General** tab, you can view and edit the name of the policy.

5. On the **Features** tab, use the check boxes to enable or disable features. By default, the most common features are displayed. To see all features that can be enabled or disabled, click **More options**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Features settings for Outlook Web App mailbox policies override Outlook Web App virtual directory settings. You can change segmentation settings for individual users by using the **Set-CASMailbox** cmdlet in the Shell.

6. On the **File Access** tab, use the **Direct file access** check boxes to configure the file access and viewing options for users. File access lets a user open or view the contents of files attached to an email message.

    File access can be controlled based on whether a user has signed in on a public or private computer. The option for users to select private computer access or public computer access is available only when you're using forms-based authentication. All other forms of authentication default to private computer access.

7. On the **Offline access** tab, use the option buttons to configure offline access availability.

8. Click **Save** to update the policy.
