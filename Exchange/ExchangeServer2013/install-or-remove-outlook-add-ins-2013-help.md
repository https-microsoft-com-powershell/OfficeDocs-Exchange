# Install or remove add-ins for Outlook for your Exchange 2013 organization

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can install or remove add-ins for Outlook for your organization by using the EAC or the Exchange Management Shell.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, after you install an add-in for your organization, the add-in is available for all users in your organization. After installation, you can use the EAC or the Exchange Management Shell to make the add-in optional or required for your users, and to specify whether you want the add-in to be enabled or disabled. For information about how to change the default settings for an add-in, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook](manage-user-access-to-add-ins-2013-help.md). To limit availability of add-ins to specific users in your organization, you must use the Exchange Management Shell. For more information, see [Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook](manage-user-access-to-add-ins-2013-help.md).

For additional management tasks, see [Add-ins for Outlook](add-ins-for-outlook-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Apps for Outlook" entry in the [Recipients Permissions](recipients-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- For more information about the EAC, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](exchange-admin-center-in-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help.md).

- You can assign administrators permission to install and manage add-ins for your organization. You can also assign users permission to install and manage add-ins for their own use. For more information, see [Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook](specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins-2013-help.md).

- Access to the Office Store isn't supported for mailboxes or organizations in specific regions. If you don't see **Add from the Office Store** as an option in the **Exchange admin center** under **Organization** \> **Add-ins** \> **New** ![Add Icon](images/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif), you may be able to install an add-in for Outlook from a URL or file location. For more information, contact your service provider.
