# Remove an address list

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

This topic explains how to remove an address list. You can't remove the default global address list (GAL).

For additional management tasks related to address lists, see [Address list procedures](address-list-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 5 minutes

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address list" entry in the [Email address and address book permissions](email-address-and-address-book-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- You can't remove a parent address list that contains child address lists. However, you can remove both the child and parent address lists by pressing the CTRL key on the keyboard, and then selecting the parent and child address lists. If you attempt to remove a parent address list without removing the child address lists, you'll receive an error.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
