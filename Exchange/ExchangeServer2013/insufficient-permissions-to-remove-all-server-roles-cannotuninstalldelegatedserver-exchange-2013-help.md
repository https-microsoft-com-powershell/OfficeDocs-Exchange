# Insufficient permissions to remove all server roles\_CannotUninstallDelegatedServer

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 setup cannot continue because the attempt to uninstall all server roles failed.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the user who is logged on when uninstalling all server roles be a member of the Exchange Organization Administrators groups, or the Enterprise Admins group.

To resolve this issue, grant the logged-on user Exchange Organization Administrator permissions or enroll them in the Enterprise Admins group, or log on with an account that has those permissions and rerun Exchange 2007 setup.
