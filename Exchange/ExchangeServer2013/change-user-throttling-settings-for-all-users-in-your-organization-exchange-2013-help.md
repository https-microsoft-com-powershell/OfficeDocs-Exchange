# Change user throttling settings for all users in your organization

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can control how resources are consumed by individual users in your Exchange organization by changing the default throttling settings.

Controlling how resources are consumed by individual users was possible in Exchange Server 2010, and this capability has been expanded for Exchange Server 2013. The policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy defines the default throttling settings for every new and existing user in your organization unless you've customized the throttling policies. In many typical Exchange deployment scenarios, the policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy is adequate to manage users.

To customize throttling settings that apply to all users in your organization, create a new throttling policy with the scope assignment Organization. You can only change the default throttling settings by using the Shell.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "User throttling" entry in the [Server health and performance permissions](server-health-and-performance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- In new Organization-scope policies, you should set only the throttling settings that are different from those in the policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy and any other organization policies. This way, the rest of the policy settings from the policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy will be inherited, as will any updates to throttling policies that are added in future Exchange updates. We recommend that you review the section "Manage throttling policies using scopes" in the topic [Exchange workload management](exchange-workload-management-exchange-2013-help.md) before following this procedure.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to change the way resources can be used by all users in your entire organization

This example creates a throttling policy that applies to all users in your organization. Any parameters that you omit inherit the values from the default throttling policy GlobalThrottlingPolicy.

```powershell
New-ThrottlingPolicy -Name AllUsersEWSPolicy EwsMaxConcurrency 4 -ThrottlingPolicyScope Organization
```

For more information about syntax and parameters, see [New-ThrottlingPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/New-ThrottlingPolicy).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created the Organization throttling policy, do the following:

1. Run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Get-ThrottlingPolicy | Format-List
   ```

2. Verify that the Organization throttling policy you just created is listed in the column that shows the GlobalThrottlingPolicy object.

3. Run the following command.

   ```powershell
   Get-ThrottlingPolicy | Format-List
   ```

4. Verify that the properties for the new Organization policy match the value or values you configured.
