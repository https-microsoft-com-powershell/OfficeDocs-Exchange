# Configure the maximum call duration in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can specify the maximum number of minutes that an incoming call can be connected to the system without being transferred to a valid extension number before the call is ended. For most organizations, this value should be set to the default: 30 minutes. This setting applies to all calls, including incoming Outlook Voice Access calls, voice calls internal to your organization, voice calls into Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendants, and fax calls placed from outside your organization.

This value can be set to a number from 10 through 120. Setting this value too low can cause incoming calls to be disconnected before they're completed. For example, if your organization receives many large fax messages, you may want to consider increasing this value from the default so that all the pages of fax messages are received.

For additional tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures in Exchange Server](um-dial-plan-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
