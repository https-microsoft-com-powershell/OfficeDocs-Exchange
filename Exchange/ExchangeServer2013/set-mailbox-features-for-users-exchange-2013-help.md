# Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

Outlook Voice Access contains two interfaces: a telephone user interface (TUI) and a voice user interface (VUI). You can configure a UM-enabled user's TUI settings when the user accesses a mailbox using the Unified Messaging (UM) system in Exchange 2013. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, the changes affect all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. You can modify the following TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy:

- PIN-less access to voice mail

- Voice responses to other messages

- TUI access to their calendar

- TUI access to the directory

- TUI access to their email

- TUI access to their personal contacts

> [!NOTE]
> You can use only the Shell to modify the Outlook Voice Access TUI settings for UM-enabled users.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to modify TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy

This example sets TUI-related settings on a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```powershell
Set-UMMailbox -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowSubscriberAccess $true -AllowTUIAccessToCalendar $false -AllowTUIAccessToDirectory $false -AllowTUIAccessToEmail -$true -AllowTUIAccessToPersonalContacts $true
```
