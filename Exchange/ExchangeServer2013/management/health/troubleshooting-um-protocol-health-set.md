# Troubleshooting UM.Protocol Health Set

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The UM.Protocol health set monitors the Unified Messaging (UM) protocol on the Mailbox server.

If you receive an alert that specifies that UM.Protocol is unhealthy, this indicates an issue that may prevent users from using the UM service in your organization. The UM.Protocol health set is closely related to the following health sets:

[Troubleshooting UM Health Set](troubleshooting-um-health-set.md)

[Troubleshooting UM.CallRouter Health Set](troubleshooting-um-callrouter-health-set.md)

## Explanation

The UM.Protocol service is monitored by using the following probes and monitors.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For more information about probes and monitors, see [Server health and performance](../../server-health-and-performance-exchange-2013-help.md).

## User Action

It's possible that the service recovered after it issued the alert. Therefore, when you receive an alert that specifies that the health set is unhealthy, first verify that the issue still exists. If the issue does exist, perform the appropriate recovery actions outlined in the following sections.

## Verifying the issue still exists

1. Identify the health set name and the server name in the alert.

2. The message details provide information about the exact cause of the alert. In most cases, the message details provide sufficient troubleshooting information to identify the root cause. If the message details are not clear, do the following:

   1. Open the Exchange Management Shell, and then run the following command to retrieve the details of the health set that issued the alert:

      ```powershell
      Get-ServerHealth <server name> | ?{$_.HealthSetName -eq "<health set name>"}
      ```

      For example, to retrieve the UM.Protocol health set details about server1.contoso.com, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Get-ServerHealth server1.contoso.com | ?{$_.HealthSetName -eq "UM.Protocol"}
      ```

   2. Review the command output to determine which monitor reported the error. The **AlertValue** value for the monitor that issued the alert will be `Unhealthy`.

   3. Rerun the associated probe for the monitor that's in an unhealthy state. Refer to the table in the Explanation section to find the associated probe. To do this, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Invoke-MonitoringProbe <health set name>\<probe name> -Server <server name> | Format-List
      ```

      For example, assume that the failing monitor is **UMSelfTestMonitor**. The probe associated with that monitor is **UMSelfTestProbe**. To run that probe on server1.contoso.com, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Invoke-MonitoringProbe UM.Protocol\UMSelfTestProbe -Server server1.contoso.com | Format-List
      ```

   4. In the command output, review the **Result** value of the probe. If the value is **Succeeded**, the issue was a transient error, and it no longer exists. Otherwise, refer to the recovery steps outlined in the following sections.

## Troubleshooting steps

When you receive an alert from a health set, the email message contains the following information:

- Name of the server that sent the alert

- Time and date when the alert occurred

- Authentication mechanism used, and credential information

- Full exception trace of the last error, including diagnostic data and specific HTTP header information

  **Note**: You can use the information in the full exception trace to help troubleshoot the issue. The exception generated by the probe contains a Failure Reason that describes why the probe failed.
