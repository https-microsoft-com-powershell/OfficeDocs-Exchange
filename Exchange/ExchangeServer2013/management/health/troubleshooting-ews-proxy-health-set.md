# Troubleshooting EWS.Proxy Health Set

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The EWS.Proxy health set monitors the availability of the Exchange Web Services (EWS) proxy infrastructure on the Client Access server (CAS). The EWS.Proxy health set is closely related to the following health set:

[Troubleshooting ClientAccess.Proxy Health Set](troubleshooting-clientaccess-proxy-health-set.md)

If you receive an alert that specifies that the EWS.Proxy is unhealthy, this indicates an issue that may prevent users from accessing the EWS service.

## Explanation

The EWS service is monitored by using the following probes and monitors.

<td><p>EWSProxyTestProbe</p></td>
<td><p>EWS.Proxy</p></td>
<td><p>Active Directory</p></td>
<td><p>EWSProxyTestMonitor</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For more information about probes and monitors, see [Server health and performance](../../server-health-and-performance-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Common issues

This probe can fail for any of the following common reasons:

- The application pool that's hosted on the monitored CAS is not working correctly.

- The monitoring account credentials are incorrect.

- The Domain Controllers are not responding.

## User Action

It's possible that the service recovered after it issued the alert. Therefore, when you receive an alert that specifies that the health set is unhealthy, first verify that the issue still exists. If the issue does exist, perform the appropriate recovery actions outlined in the following sections.

## Verifying the issue still exists

1. Identify the health set name and the server name in the alert.

2. The message details provide information about the exact cause of the alert. In most cases, the message details provide sufficient troubleshooting information to identify the root cause. If the message details are not clear, do the following:

   1. Open the Exchange Management Shell, and then run the following command to retrieve the details of the health set that issued the alert:

      ```powershell
      Get-ServerHealth <server name> | ?{$_.HealthSetName -eq "<health set name>"}
      ```

      For example, to retrieve the EWS.Proxy health set details about server1.contoso.com, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Get-ServerHealth server1.contoso.com | ?{$_.HealthSetName -eq "EWS.Proxy"}
      ```

   2. Review the command output to determine which monitor reported the error. The **AlertValue** value for the monitor that issued the alert will be `Unhealthy`.

   3. Rerun the associated probe for the monitor that is in an unhealthy state. Refer to the table in the Verifying the issue still exists section to find the associated probe. To do this, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Invoke-MonitoringProbe <health set name>\<probe name> -Server <server name> | Format-List
      ```

      For example, assume that the failing monitor is **EWSProxyTestMonitor**. The probe associated with that monitor is **EWSProxyTestProbe**. To run that probe on server1.contoso.com, run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Invoke-MonitoringProbe EWS.Proxy\EWSProxyTestProbe -Server server1.contoso.com | Format-List
      ```

   4. In the command output, review the **Result** value of the probe. If the value is **Succeeded**, the issue was a transient error, and it no longer exists. Otherwise, refer to the recovery steps outlined in the following sections.

## EWSProxyTestMonitor Recovery Actions

When you receive an alert from a health set, the email message will contain the following information:

- Name of the CAS that sent the alert

- Full exception trace of the last error, including diagnostic data and specific HTTP header information

  You can use the information in the full exception trace to help troubleshoot the issue.

- Time and date when the issue occurred

To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:

1. Review the protocol logs on CA servers. Protocol logs are located in the *\<exchange server installation directory\>*\\Logging\\HttpProxy*\\\<protocol\>* folder on the CAS.

2. Create a test user account, and then log on to the CAS by using the test user account. For example, use the following logon address: https:// *\<servername\>*/owa

3. Start IIS Manager, and then connect to the server that's reporting the issue to determine whether the **MSExchangeServicesAppPool** application pool is running on the CAS.

4. Click **Application Pools**, and then recycle the **MSExchangeServicesAppPool** application pool by running the following command from the Shell:

   ```powershell
   %SystemRoot%\System32\inetsrv\Appcmd recycle MSExchangeServicesAppPool
   ```

5. Rerun the associated probe as shown in step 2c in the Verifying the issue still exists section.

6. If the issue still exists, recycle the IIS service by using the IISReset utility.

7. Rerun the associated probe as shown in step 2c in the Verifying the issue still exists section.

8. If the issue still exists, restart the server.

9. After the server restarts, rerun the associated probe as shown in step 2c in the Verifying the issue still exists section.

10. If the probe continues to fail, you may need assistance to resolve this issue. Contact a Microsoft Support professional to resolve this issue. To contact a Microsoft Support professional, visit [Support for business](https://support.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/productselection) and then select **Servers** \> **Exchange Server**. Because your organization may have a specific procedure for directly contacting Microsoft Product Support Services, be sure to review your organization's guidelines first.
