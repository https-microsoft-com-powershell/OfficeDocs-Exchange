# Telephony advisor for Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

Unified Messaging (UM) requires that you integrate Microsoft Exchange with the existing telephony system for your organization. A successful deployment requires you to make a careful analysis of your existing telephony infrastructure and to perform the correct planning steps to deploy Unified Messaging.

The planning phase can be a significant challenge to Exchange administrators who have little or no experience with a telephony network. To help address this challenge, see the following section **Resources to help with your UM deployment**.

The other sections in this topic cover the supported VoIP gateways for Unified Messaging, how to determine whether your PBX is supported using a specific VoIP gateway model or manufacturer, whether your IP PBX is supported using a direct SIP connection, and supported session border controllers (SBCs) for Exchange Online UM.

## Resources to help with your UM deployment

It's challenging to create guidelines for deploying telephony networks. They can be very different from one another because they can include VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and PBXs with different configuration settings, firmware, and requirements. However, several resources are available to help you successfully deploy Unified Messaging:

- **Unified Messaging specialists**: UM specialists are systems integrators who have received technical training about Exchange Unified Messaging conducted by the Exchange engineering team. To help ensure a smooth transition to Unified Messaging from legacy voice mail systems, Microsoft recommends that all customers engage a UM specialist. To contact a Unified Messaging specialist, see the [Microsoft solution providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/) page.

- **Configuration Notes for Supported VoIP Gateways, IP PBXs and PBXs**: These configuration notes contain settings and other information that's very useful when you're configuring VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and PBXs to communicate with the Unified Messaging servers that are on your network. For more information, see [Configuration notes for supported VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and PBXs](configuration-notes-for-voip-gateways-exchange-2013-help.md).

Before you engage a Unified Messaging specialist, you should be able to answer key questions that they'll ask. Having the answers to the following questions will help make the conversation between you and the UM specialist productive:

- How many existing telephone or voice mail users, or both, are in your organization?

- How many users do you intend to provide with Unified Messaging?

- Which PBX or PBXs do you intend to use for integration with Unified Messaging?

- How many PBXs does your organization have? Specify the vendors, types (circuit- or IP-based), models, and firmware versions.

- Are the PBXs networked, and are they centralized or located in multiple locations?

- What voice mail system or systems does your organization currently use? Specify the vendors, types, models, and firmware versions.

- How are the voice mail systems integrated into your PBXs (Analog, T1/E1, PRI, Digital set emulation, VoIP, other)?

- Are you currently using voice networking?

- What type of fax system or systems does your organization use, and does the fax system or systems support inbound fax routing to Exchange?

- Does your organization use automated attendants?

- Do you need support for phone-only users, that is, users who won't have email access?

## Supported VoIP gateways

Integrating Unified Messaging with PBXs requires you to use one or more VoIP gateways to translate the circuit-switched protocols that are used by TDM-based PBXs to IP-based, packet-switched protocols that are used by Unified Messaging. VoIP gateway vendors with several models of VoIP and media gateways have been tested and are supported for Unified Messaging.

Interoperability testing of Unified Messaging with VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and SBCs is now integrated with the Microsoft Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program. For more information, see [Microsoft Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program](/SkypeForBusiness/lync-cert/qualified-lync-apps).

The [Microsoft Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program](/SkypeForBusiness/lync-cert/qualified-lync-apps) qualification program for VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and advanced VoIP gateways ensures that customers have a seamless setup and support experience when they're using qualified telephony VoIP gateways and IP PBXs with Microsoft Unified Communications software. Only products that meet rigorous and extensive testing requirements and conform to the specifications and test plans receive qualification.

For details about configuring supported VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and PBXs see [Configuration notes for supported VoIP gateways, IP PBXs, and PBXs](configuration-notes-for-voip-gateways-exchange-2013-help.md).

Interoperability was verified for the following VoIP gateway vendors:

- AudioCodes

## Supported PBXs when using a Dialogic VoIP gateway

Each Dialogic VoIP gateway model supports different PBXs. The following tables show the PBX manufacturer and model and which Dialogic VoIP gateway can be used. Each VoIP gateway uses different signaling methods, densities, and protocols.

### PBXs supported when using a DMG1000 series Media Gateway

The following table shows the PBXs that are supported with the low-density Dialogic Media Gateway (DMG1000). However, when an analog DMG1000 is used, supplemental signaling (RS232 SMDI, MD110, MCI protocols, or Inband DTMF signaling) is required.

### PBXs supported when using a DMG 2000 series Media Gateway

The following table shows the PBXs that are supported with the T1/E1 Dialogic Media Gateway (DMG2000). The DMG2000 gateway, which comes in single span (DMG2030DTIQ), dual span (DMG2060DTIQ), or quad span (DMG2120DTIQ) densities, supports the following protocols:

- T1 CAS

- T1 Q.SIG

- E1 Q.SIG

- T1 NI-2

- T1 5ESS

- T1 DMS100

If Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) signaling is used, supplemental signaling (RS232 SMDI, MD110, MCI protocols, or Inband DTMF signaling) is required. If Q.SIG signaling is used, the PBX must support the supplemental services that are associated with calling and called party information and the call transfer capabilities required by Unified Messaging.
