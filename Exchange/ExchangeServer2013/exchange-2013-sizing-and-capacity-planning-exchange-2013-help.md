Sizing and capacity planning for Exchange Server 2013 is an important part of your Exchange 2013 deployment. Configuring a system for optimum performance is an iterative process. Take the time to understand all the variables that affect your system, including user profile, architecture, and hardware. With this knowledge, you can establish baseline metrics for your systems and make adjustments to improve system performance.
