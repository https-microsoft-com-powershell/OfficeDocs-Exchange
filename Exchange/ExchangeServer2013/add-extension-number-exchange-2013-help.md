# Add an extension number in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When you enable a user for UM and link them to a telephone extension dial plan, an EUM proxy address is created for the user that contains the user's extension number. You must define at least one extension number for UM to use so voice mail can be sent to the user's mailbox. The extension number is also used when the user calls in to an Outlook Voice Access number.

The primary extension number you added when the user was enabled for UM will be listed as the primary EUM proxy address. If the primary extension number was removed, the first EUM proxy address you add that contains the user's extension number will become the primary EUM proxy address. Any additional extension numbers you add will be listed as secondary EUM proxy addresses. When additional secondary extension numbers are added, callers can leave voice mail for the user at all extension numbers that have been set. All the voice messages will be delivered to the same user's mailbox.

You can use the EAC or the Shell to add a primary or a secondary extension number for a user. You can use the **Email Address** page on the user's mailbox in the EAC to add a primary or secondary extension number. You can't use the **UM Mailbox** page in the EAC to add a primary extension number, but you can use that page to add secondary extension numbers.

You can view the primary and secondary extension numbers for a user by using the **Get-UMMailbox** cmdlet or the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet in the Shell.

For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to add an extension number

This example adds an extension number 22222 for Tony Smith, a UM-enabled user.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you add an extension number using the Shell, you need to determine the position of the EUM proxy address that you want to add. To determine the position, use the **$mbx.EmailAddresses** command. The first proxy address in the list will be 0.

```powershell
$mbx=Get-Mailbox tony.smith
$mbx.EmailAddresses +="eum:22222;phone-context=MyDialPlan.contoso.com"
Set-Mailbox tony.smith -EmailAddresses $mbx.EmailAddresses
```
