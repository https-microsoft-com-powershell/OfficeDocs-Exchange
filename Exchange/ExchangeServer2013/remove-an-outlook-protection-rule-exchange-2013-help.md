# Remove an Outlook Protection Rule

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Using Microsoft Outlook protection rules, you can protect messages with Information Rights Management (IRM) by applying an [Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831364(v=ws.11)x) template in Outlook 2010 before the messages are sent. To prevent an Outlook protection rule from being applied, you can disable the rule. Removing an Outlook protection rule removes the rule definition from Active Directory.

For additional management tasks related to IRM, see [Information Rights Management procedures](information-rights-management-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to completion: 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Rights protection" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to remove Outlook protection rules. You must use the Shell.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
