# Modify, disable, or remove a sharing policy

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Sharing policies allow individual users in your Exchange organization to share calendar free/busy information with other federated Exchange organizations, non-federated Exchange organizations, and individual Internet users. During the course of normal operations, you may want to change some sharing policy properties, such as modifying sharing rules, changing the free/busy access level, temporarily disabling a sharing policy, or removing a sharing policy entirely.

To learn more about federated sharing, see [Sharing](sharing-exchange-2013-help.md)

For details about how to create a sharing policy, see [Create a sharing policy](create-a-sharing-policy-exchange-2013-help.md)

## Use the Shell to modify, disable or remove a sharing policy

- This example modifies the sharing policy Contoso for contoso.com, which is a domain outside your organization. This policy allows users in the Contoso domain to see simple free/busy information.

    ```powershell
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'sales.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple'
    ```

- This example adds a second domain to the sharing policy Contoso. When you're adding a domain to an existing policy, you must include any previously included domains.

    ```powershell
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple', 'atlanta.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer', 'beijing.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer'
    ```

- This example sets the sharing policy Contoso as the default sharing policy.

    ```powershell
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Default $True
    ```

- This example disables the sharing policy Contoso.

    ```powershell
    Set-SharingPolicy -Identity "Contoso" -Enabled $False
    ```

- The first example removes the sharing policy Contoso. The second example removes the sharing policy Contoso and suppresses the confirmation that you want to remove the policy.

  ```powershell
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso
  ```

  ```powershell
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Confirm
  ```
