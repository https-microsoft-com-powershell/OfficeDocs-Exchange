# Remove an address book policy in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Use this procedure to remove an address book policy (ABP).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address book policies" entry in the [Email address and address book permissions](email-address-and-address-book-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

- You can't remove an ABP if it's assigned to a user's mailbox or to a soft-deleted mailbox. To determine if an ABP is assigned to a user, run the following Shell command:

  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox | Where $._AddressBookPolicy -eq <AddressBookPolicyName>
  ```

  To determine if an ABP is assigned to a soft-deleted mailbox, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox | Where $._AddressBookPolicy -eq <AddressBookPolicyName>
  ```

- To remove an ABP from a user's mailbox, you can use the **Mailbox features** page of the mailbox's properties or the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet.

- You can't use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to remove an ABP. You must use the Shell.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center in Exchange 2013](keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-exchange-admin-center-2013-help.md).
