Microsoft Exchange ServerÂ 2007 setup cannot continue because its attempt to use the specified domain controller failed. A domain controller has been statically mapped in the registry.

Exchange 2007 setup requires that the domain controller specified in the setup command match the domain controller that has been statically mapped using a registry override.

To resolve this issue, run setup again, specifying the statically mapped domain controller for the **/DomainController: \<***FQDN of the* *statically mapped domain controller***\>** parameter.
