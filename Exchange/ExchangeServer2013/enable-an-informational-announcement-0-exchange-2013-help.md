# Enable an informational announcement in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can enable an informational announcement for a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant. When an informational announcement is enabled, it will play immediately after the business or non-business hours greeting. By default, an informational announcement isn't configured. To enable an informational announcement, create a .wav or .wma file to be used as the informational announcement, and then configure the auto attendant to use this sound file.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

## Use the Shell to enable an informational announcement

This example enables an informational announcement that uses the `MyInfoAnnouncement.wav` file for the UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant`.

Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -InfoAnnouncementEnabled $true -InfoAnnouncementFilename MyInfoAnnouncement.wav
```
