# Remove an In-Place eDiscovery search in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, you can use In-Place eDiscovery to search mailbox content. You can remove an In-Place eDiscovery search at any time. When you remove an In-Place eDiscovery search, search results are removed from the Discovery mailbox.

> [!CAUTION]
> Deleting an In-Place eDiscovery search will remove any search results copied to a Discovery mailbox.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to completion: 2-5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "In-Place eDiscovery" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](messaging-policy-and-compliance-permissions-exchange-2013-help.md) topic.

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully removed an In-Place eDiscovery search, do one of the following:

- Use the EAC to verify that the search is no longer displayed in the list view of the **In-place eDiscovery & hold** tab.

- Use the **Get-MailboxSearch** cmdlet to retrieve In-Place eDiscovery searches. For an example of how to retrieve In-Place eDiscovery searches, see the "Examples" section in [Get-MailboxSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailboxsearch).
