# Set the number of sign-in failures before a voice mail user Is locked out in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can configure the number of sign-in failures allowed before an Outlook Voice Access user is locked out of their mailbox. The number of sign-in failures allowed before a voice mail user is locked out is configured on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy, and applies to all UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy. By default it is set to 15.

To increase security, decrease the maximum number of failed attempts. However, remember that if you decrease it to a number much lower than the default, users may be locked out unnecessarily. Unified Messaging will generate warning events you can view using Event Viewer if PIN authentication fails for UM-enabled users or if users are unsuccessful when they try to sign in to the system. This setting must be larger than the setting for the number of sign-in failures before the PIN is reset.

For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the EAC to configure the number of sign-in failures before a voice mail user is locked out

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**.

2. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM dial plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

4. Click **PIN policies**, and next to **Number of sign-in failures before lockout**, enter a value between 1 and 999.

5. Click **Save**.

## Use the Shell to configure the number of sign-in failures before a voice mail user is locked out

This example sets the maximum number sign-in attempts to 10 for UM-enabled users who are associated with a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -MaxLogonAttempts 10
```

This example sets the number of sign-in failures before the Outlook Voice Access user's PIN is reset to 3, the maximum number of sign-in attempts to 5, and a minimum PIN length to 9 for UM-enabled users who are associated with a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```powershell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -LogonFailuresBeforePINReset 3
-MaxLogonAttempts 5 -MinPINLength 9
```
