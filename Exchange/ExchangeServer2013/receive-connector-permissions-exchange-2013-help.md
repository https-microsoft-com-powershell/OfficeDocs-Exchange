</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>ms-Exch-SMTP-Submit</p></td>
<td><p>The session must be granted this permission or it will be unable to submit messages to this Receive connector. If a session doesn't have this permission, the MAIL FROM and AUTH commands will fail.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>ms-Exch-SMTP-Accept-Any-Recipient</p></td>
<td><p>This permission allows the session to relay messages through this connector. If this permission isn't granted, only messages that are addressed to recipients in accepted domains are accepted by this connector.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>ms-Exch-SMTP-Accept-Any-Sender</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>ms-Exch-SMTP-Accept-Authoritative-Domain-Sender</p></td>
<td><p>This permission allows senders that have e-mail addresses in authoritative domains to establish a session to this Receive connector.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>ms-Exch-SMTP-Accept-Authentication-Flag</p></td>
<td><p>This permission allows Exchange 2003 servers to submit messages from internal senders. Exchange 2010 will recognize the messages as being internal. The sender can declare the message as trusted. Messages that enter your Exchange system through anonymous submissions will be relayed through your Exchange organization with this flag in an untrusted state.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>ms-Exch-Accept-Headers-Routing</p></td>
<td><p>This permission allows the session to submit a message that has all received headers intact. If this permission isn't granted, the server will strip all received headers.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>ms-Exch-Accept-Headers-Organization</p></td>
<td><p>This permission allows the session to submit a message that has all organization headers intact. Organization headers all start with <strong>X-MS-Exchange-Organization-</strong>. If this permission isn't granted, the receiving server will strip all organization headers.</p></td>
