# Enable or disable MAPI for a mailbox in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use the Exchange admin center or the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable MAPI for a user mailbox. When MAPI is enabled, a user's mailbox can be accessed by Outlook or other MAPI email clients. When MAPI is disabled, it can't be accessed by Outlook or other MAPI clients. However, the mailbox will continue to receive email messages, and, assuming that the mailbox is enabled to support access by those clients, a user can access the mailbox to send and receive email by using Outlook Web App, a POP email client, or an IMAP client.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Outlook Web App and MAPI, POP3, and IMAP4 email clients is enabled by default when a user mailbox is created.

For additional management tasks related to managing email client access to a mailbox, see the following topics:

- [Enable or disable Outlook Web App for a mailbox](enable-or-disable-outlook-web-app-exchange-2013-help.md)

- [Enable or disable IMAP4 access for a user](enable-or-disable-imap4-access-for-a-user-exchange-2013-help.md)

- [Enable or disable POP3 access for a user](enable-or-disable-pop3-access-for-a-user-exchange-2013-help.md)

## What do you need to know before you begin?

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable MAPI

This example disables MAPI for the mailbox of Ken Sanchez.

```powershell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Ken Sanchez" -MAPIEnabled $false
```

This example enables MAPI for the mailbox of Esther Valle.

```powershell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Esther Valle" -MAPIEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-casmailbox).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled MAPI for a user mailbox, do one of the following:

- In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**, click the mailbox, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](images/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

- On the mailbox properties page, click **Mailbox Features**.

- Under **Email Connectivity**, verify whether MAPI is enabled or disabled.

Or

- Run the following command in the Exchange Management Shell.

  ```powershell
  Get-CASMailbox <identity>
  ```

    If MAPI is enabled, the value for the _MapiEnabled_ property is `True`. If MAPI is disabled, the value is `False`.
