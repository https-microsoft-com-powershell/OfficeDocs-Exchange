# Built-in role groups

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 includes several management role groups by default. The following built-in role groups provide you with a preconfigured set of roles that you can assign to various administrator and specialist users in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Role groups don't control access to end-user mailbox features. To control access to end-user mailbox features, see <A href="understanding-management-role-assignment-policies-exchange-2013-help.md">Understanding management role assignment policies</A>.
