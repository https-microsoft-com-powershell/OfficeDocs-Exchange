# Configure business hours in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

When you configure business hours for a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant, you define the hours of the day that your organization is open, and the business hours greetings and menu prompts callers will hear when they call an extension number that's configured on the auto attendant. If a caller reaches the auto attendant during hours that are outside the business hours you define, the caller will hear the non-business hours prompts and greetings.

Several default schedule options are available in the EAC. For example, most businesses are open from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday. Sometimes the default options won't fit your needs and you'll want to customize the schedule. If your business hours vary from the schedules defined by the system, you can define a customized schedule for the auto attendant.

By default, the UM auto attendant will play the business hours prompts and greetings regardless of the time of day callers dial in to the auto attendant.

> [!NOTE]
> When you set the schedule for business and non-business hours on a UM auto attendant, make sure the time zone is configured correctly.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
