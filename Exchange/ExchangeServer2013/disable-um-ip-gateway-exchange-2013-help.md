# Disable a UM IP gateway in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

By default, when you create a Unified Messaging (UM) IP gateway, the status of the UM IP gateway is enabled. After the UM IP gateway is created, you can disable the operation of the gateway by setting its status to disabled. After you disable the UM IP gateway, the Voice over IP (VoIP) gateway, IP Private Branch eXchange (PBX), or session border controller (SBC) that it's configured to use can no longer process incoming Unified Messaging calls.

 For additional management tasks related to UM IP gateways, see [UM IP gateway procedures](um-ip-gateway-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).
