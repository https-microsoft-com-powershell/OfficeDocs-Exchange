# Get Recoverable Items folder statistics

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The Recoverable Items folder contains items deleted by Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft OfficeÂ Outlook Web App users or by the Mailbox Assistant. The duration that deleted items remain in this folder is based on the deleted item retention settings configured for the mailbox database or the mailbox. By default, a mailbox database is configured to retain deleted items for 14 days, and the Recoverable Items warning quota and Recoverable Items quota are set to 20 gigabytes (GB) and 30 GB respectively. However, if In-Place Hold or Litigation Hold is enabled for the mailbox, the Recoverable Items folder can accumulate deleted items beyond the specified retention period and can also maintain different versions of modified mailbox items.

When the Recoverable Items folder reaches the Recoverable Items warning quota, a warning event is logged in the Application event log. If the mailbox isn't on Litigation Hold, items are then removed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. However, if the mailbox is on Litigation Hold, the mailbox is never emptied and upon reaching the Recoverable Items quota, mailbox functionality is impacted.

Therefore, it's important to monitor the event log for alerts generated when mailboxes reach the Recoverable Items quotas. You can also use this procedure to report statistics for the Recoverable Items folder, particularly for mailboxes placed on Litigation Hold.
