# Enable IMAP4 in Exchange 2013

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

Learn how to enable IMAP4 client connectivity in Exchange 2016 using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or the Exchange Management Shell (EMS).

When you installExchange Server 2016, IMAP4 client connectivity isn't enabled. To enable IMAP4 client connectivity, you need to start two IMAP services, the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service and the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 Backend service. When you enable IMAP4, Exchange 2016 accepts unsecured IMAP4 client communications on port 143 and over port 993 using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

You manage both IMAP4 and IMAP4 Backend services on the same Exchange 2016 computer running the Mailbox server role. In Exchange 2016, Client Access services are part of the Mailbox server role so you no longer manage the services separately.

For more information about how to set up POP3 and IMAP4, see [POP3 and IMAP4 in Exchange Server 2013](pop3-and-imap4-in-exchange-server-2013-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to enable IMAP4

On the computer running the Mailbox server role:

1. In the **Services** snap-in, in the console tree, click **Services (Local)**.

2. In the result pane, right-click **Microsoft Exchange IMAP4**, and then click **Properties**.

3. In the result pane, right-click **Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 Backend**, and then click **Properties**.

4. On the **General** tab, under **Startup type**, select **Automatic**, and then click **Apply**.

5. Under **Service status**, click **Start**, and then click **OK**.

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable IMAP4

On the computer running the Mailbox server role:

1. Set the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service to start automatically.

   ```powershell
   Set-service msExchangeIMAP4 -startuptype automatic
   ```

2. Start the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service.

   ```powershell
   Start-service msExchangeIMAP4
   ```

3. Set the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 Backend service to start automatically.

   ```powershell
   Set-service msExchangeIMAP4BE -startuptype automatic
   ```

4. Start the Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 Backend service.

   ```powershell
   Start-service msExchangeIMAP4BE
   ```

## How do you know this worked?

On the Exchange 2016 Mailbox server, open Windows Task Manager. On the **Services** tab, the status for **MSExchangeIMAP4** and for **MSExchangeIMAP4BE** will show as **Running** if IMAP4 is enabled.
