# Enable or disable a call answering rule for a user in Exchange Server

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016_

You can use the Shell to enable or disable one or more call answering rules for a user. You can also use the **Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule** or **Disable-UMCallAnsweringRule** cmdlets in an Exchange Management Shell script to enable or disable one or more call answering rules for multiple users.

Call answering rules are applied to incoming calls similar to the way Inbox rules are applied to incoming email messages. By default, when a user is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM), no call answering rules are configured. Even so, incoming calls are answered by the mail system and callers are prompted to leave a voice message.

For additional management tasks related to call answering rules, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures-exchange-2013-help.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

## Use the Shell to enable a call answering rule

When a call answering rule is created, it's enabled. You can use the Shell to enable a call answering rule that was previously disabled. Enabling a call answering rule enables the **Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule** cmdlet to retrieve the call answering rule, including the conditions and actions for a specified call answering rule.

This example enables the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith.

```powershell
Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith
```

The example uses the _WhatIf_ switch to test whether the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith is ready to be enabled and if there are any errors within the command.

```powershell
Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith -WhatIf
```

This example enables the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith and prompts the signed-in user to confirm that the call answering rule is to be enabled.

```powershell
Enable-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith -Confirm
```

## Use the Shell to disable a call answering rule

Disabling a call answering rule prevents it from being retrieved and processed when an incoming call is received. When you create a call answering rule, you should disable it while you're setting up conditions and actions. This prevents the call answering rule from being processed when an incoming call is received before you've correctly configured the call answering rule.

This example disables the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith.

```powershell
Disable -UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith
```

This example uses the _WhatIf_ switch to test whether the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith is ready to be disabled and if there are any errors within the command.

```powershell
Disable -UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith -WhatIf
```

This example disables the call answering rule `MyUMCallAnsweringRule` in the mailbox for Tony Smith and prompts the signed-in user to confirm that they're disabling the call answering rule.

```powershell
Disable-UMCallAnsweringRule -Identity MyUMCallAnsweringRule -Mailbox tonysmith -Confirm
```
