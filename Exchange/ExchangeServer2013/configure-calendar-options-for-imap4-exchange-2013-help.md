# Configure calendar options for IMAP4

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use the Shell to configure calendaring access settings for your users who connect to their mailboxes using IMAP4 connections. The settings you specify determine how your IMAP4 users can access their calendar and exchange calendar information (for example, send or respond to a meeting request) with other users.

For additional information related to IMAP4, see [POP3 and IMAP4 in Exchange Server 2013](pop3-and-imap4-in-exchange-server-2013-exchange-2013-help.md).

## Use the Shell to set the calendar options for IMAP4

This example enables IMAP4 users to use the iCalendar standard, a standard for exchanging calendar information.

```powershell
Set-ImapSettings -Server CAS01 -CalendarItemRetrievalOption iCalendar
```

This example enables IMAP4 users to access calendar information from an internal server.

```powershell
Set-ImapSettings -Server CAS01 -CalendarItemRetrievalOption IntranetUrl
```

This example enables IMAP4 users to access calendar information from the Internet on an external server.

```powershell
Set-ImapSettings -CalendarItemRetrievalOption InternetUrl
```

This example enables IMAP4 users to access calendar information by using a direct Outlook Web App URL. If you're using `Custom`, you must specify an Outlook Web App URL using the *OWAServerUrl* parameter.

```powershell
Set-Imap4Settings -CalendarItemRetrievalOption Custom -OwaServerUrl "https://OwaServer01"
```

After you've specified the calendar options for IMAP4, you must restart the IMAP4 services. For information about how to restart the IMAP4 services, see [Start and stop the IMAP4 services](start-and-stop-the-imap4-services-exchange-2013-help.md).

For more information about syntax and parameters, see [Set-ImapSettings](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-ImapSettings).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully set calendar options, do the following:

Run the following command in the Shell.

```powershell
Get-ImapSettings | format-list
```

Verify that the calendar settings are correct.
