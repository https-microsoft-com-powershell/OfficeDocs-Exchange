# Mobile device mailbox policies

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

In MicrosoftÂ Exchange Server 2013, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. After you deploy Exchange ActiveSync in your Exchange 2013 organization, you can create new mobile device mailbox policies or modify existing policies. When you install Exchange 2013, a default mobile device mailbox policy is created. All users are automatically assigned this default mobile device mailbox policy.

## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following:

  - Require a password.

  - Specify the minimum password length.

  - Require a number or special character in the password.

  - Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password.

  - Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts.

For more information about all the settings you can configure, see Mobile device policy settings.

## Managing Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policies

Mobile device mailbox policies can be created in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using the Shell.

## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.
