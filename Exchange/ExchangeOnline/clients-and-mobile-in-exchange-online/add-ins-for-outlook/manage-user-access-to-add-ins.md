# Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook in Exchange Online

We recommend that you manage Office add-ins for your Exchange Online organization via Centralized Deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage deployment of add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins).
