2. In the new policy window that opens, configure the following settings:

   - **Policy name**: Enter a unique name for your policy.

   - Use the check boxes to enable or disable features. By default, the most common features are displayed. To see all features that can be enabled or disabled, click **More options**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to create an Outlook on the web mailbox policy

In Exchange Online PowerShell, creating an Outlook on the web mailbox policy is a two-step process:

1. Create the policy by using the following syntax:

   ```PowerShell

   ```

   This example creates an Outlook on the web mailbox policy named Executives.

   New-OwaMailboxPolicy -Name Policy1
   ```
