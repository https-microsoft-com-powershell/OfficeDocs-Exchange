# Customize and schedule mail protection reports to be automatically sent to your inbox

As an Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection (EOP) admin, you probably want to keep an eye on your organization's mail flow, how much spam and malware is being detected, or how often your rules and policies are being matched. By using mail protection reports, you'll get a quick summary of the messages that Microsoft 365 or Office 365 has delivered or rejected based on spam or malware characteristics, rules, or data loss prevention (DLP) policies.

You can choose to either schedule mail protection reports to be sent to your inbox automatically, or you can view them any time in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

To get started customizing and downloading reports, see the following articles:

- [View email security reports in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports)
- [View Defender for Office 365 reports in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](//microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-reports-for-mdo)
