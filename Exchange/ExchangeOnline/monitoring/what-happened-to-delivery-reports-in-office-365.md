# What happened to delivery reports?

Delivery reports in Microsoft 365 and Office 365 allowed users and administrators to discover and view delivery information about mail messages. Delivery reports for users have been discontinued and there is currently no direct replacement. Delivery reports for administrators have been replaced by the **Message Trace** feature.

For more information, see these topics:

- [Trace an email message](trace-an-email-message/trace-an-email-message.md)
- [Message trace in the modern Exchange admin center](trace-an-email-message/message-trace-modern-eac.md)
- [Run a message trace and view the results in the Exchange admin center](trace-an-email-message/run-a-message-trace-and-view-results.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The **Exchange message trace** link in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal opens message trace in the modern EAC.
> - Delivery reports for users and administrators is still available in on-premises Exchange environments. For more information, see [Track messages with delivery reports](../../ExchangeServer/mail-flow/transport-logs/track-messages-with-delivery-reports.md).
> - Read receipts and delivery notifications are separate from delivery reports and are still available in Microsoft 365 and Office 365. For more information, see [Add and request read receipts and delivery notifications](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-and-request-read-receipts-and-delivery-notifications-a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141).
