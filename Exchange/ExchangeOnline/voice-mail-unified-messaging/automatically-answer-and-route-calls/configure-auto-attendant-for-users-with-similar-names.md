# Configure an auto attendant for users who have similar names in Exchange Online

You can configure the method to use for users with similar names on an auto attendant's **Address book and operator access** options, or you can leave the default setting on the auto attendant and configure this setting on the dial plan associated with the auto attendant. By default, an auto attendant can disambiguate between two or more users who have the same or similar names because the default setting on the auto attendant is **Inherit from dial plan**.

> [!NOTE]
> For the information that will be included for users with similar names to work correctly, you must provide the title, department, and location information for the recipients in your Microsoft Exchange organization.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure a UM auto attendant for users with similar names

This example sets the information to be included with users with similar names to Prompt for Alias for a UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -MatchedNameSelectionMethod PromptForAlias
```

This example sets the information to be included with users with similar names to the title of the users, enables name lookups, and enables callers that dial into the auto attendant to press \* to be presented with the Outlook Voice Access welcome greeting for a UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -MatchedNameSelectionMethod Title -NameLookupEnabled $true -StarOutToDialPlanEnabled $true
```
