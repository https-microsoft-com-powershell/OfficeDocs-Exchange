# Configure the time zone in Exchange Online

By default, the Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant uses the time zone of the Mailbox server on which it's created. However, there are situations where you may have to change the time zone for a UM auto attendant to a different time zone. For example, if you have two UM dial plans and each dial plan represents a different time zone, you must configure one UM auto attendant to have the same time zone as the Mailbox server and the other UM auto attendant to have a time zone that differs from the Mailbox server.

For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to configure the time zone

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant for which you want to set the time zone, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page, click **Business Hours**, and then, under **Time zone**, select the time zone from the drop-down list.

4. To save your changes, click **OK**, and then click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the time zone

This example sets the time zone to the Pacific time zone on a UM auto attendant named `MyUMAutoAttendant`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -TimeZoneName Pacific
```
