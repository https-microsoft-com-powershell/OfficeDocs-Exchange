# Delete a UM mailbox policy in Exchange Online

When you delete a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy, the UM mailbox policy will no longer be available to be associated with recipients who are being enabled for UM. You can't delete a UM mailbox policy if it's referenced by any UM-enabled mailboxes, and you can't delete a UM dial plan if a UM mailbox policy is associated with it.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?
