# Include text with the email message sent when a voice message Is received in Exchange Online

You can include additional text in the email message that's sent when a voice mail message is received by a user who is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) voice mail. By default, the text that's included with a voice message indicates only that the user has received a voice message. However, you can create a custom message by adding text in the **When a user receives a voice message** box on a UM mailbox policy. For example, the text can include information about system security policies and describe the correct way to handle voice messages in your organization. After you add the text, it will be included in each email message that's sent when UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy receive a voice message.

> [!NOTE]
> The custom text that accompanies a voice message is limited to 512 characters, and can include simple HTML text.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to change the text included with a voice message

2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to manage, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM Mailbox Policy** page \> **Message text**, in the text box for **When a user receives a voice message**, enter the text you want to include in the email message that's sent when users receive a voice message.

4. Click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to change the text included with a voice message

This example includes the additional text, "Do not forward voice messages to users outside this organization", with voice messages sent to users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -VoiceMailText "Do not forward voice messages to users outside this organization."
```
