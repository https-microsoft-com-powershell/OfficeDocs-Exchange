# Retrieve voice mail PIN information in Exchange Online

You can retrieve PIN information for a user who is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM). After a user has been enabled for UM-enabled and a PIN is generated or created, the PIN is encrypted and stored in the user's mailbox.

When you retrieve PIN information for a UM-enabled user, the information returned to you is calculated by using the encrypted PIN data stored in the user's mailbox. This lets you view information from the user's mailbox and also indicates whether the user has been locked out of the mailbox.

For additional tasks related to PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to retrieve PIN information for a UM-enabled user

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients**. In the list view, select the user mailbox that you want to view.

2. In the details pane, under **Phone and Voice Features**, click **View details**.

3. On the **UM Mailbox** page \> **UM mailbox settings**, view the **PIN status** for the user. On this page, you can also reset the voice mail PIN for the user.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to retrieve PIN information for a UM-enabled user

This example displays the user ID, whether a PIN is expired, whether the UM mailbox is locked out, and whether Tony is a first-time user.

```PowerShell

```
