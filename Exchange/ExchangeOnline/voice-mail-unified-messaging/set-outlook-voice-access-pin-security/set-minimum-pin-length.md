# Set the minimum PIN length for voice mail in Exchange Online

You can configure the minimum PIN length for your Outlook Voice Access users who are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM). The PIN settings that you configure on a UM mailbox policy will apply to all UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy.

Outlook Voice Access is used by UM-enabled users to access their voice mail, email, calendar, and personal contact information located in their mailbox. However, before they can access their mailbox, they must enter a PIN so they can be authenticated by the voice mail system.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the minimum PIN length value, existing Outlook Voice Access users will be prompted to enter a new PIN that contains the new minimum number of digits before they can continue. The default is 6.

For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/create-um-dial-plan.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/create-um-mailbox-policy.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the minimum PIN length for Outlook Voice Access

This example sets the minimum PIN length to 8 digits for Outlook Voice Access users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -MinPINLength 8
```

This example sets the minimum PIN length to 8 digits and sets the number of times a sign-in can fail before the user's PIN is reset to 3. This applies to UM-enabled users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -LogonFailuresBeforePINReset 3 -MinPINLength 8
```
