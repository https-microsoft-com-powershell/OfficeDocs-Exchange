# Set the number of previous voice mail PINs to recycle in Exchange Online

When Outlook Voice Access users dial in to an Outlook Voice Access number, they're prompted to enter their PIN so that the voice mail system can authenticate them. After they're authenticated, they can access the voice mail, email, calendaring, and personal contact information in their mailbox from any telephone.

Several PIN-related settings can be configured on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. The **PIN recycle count** setting specifies the number of unique PINs users must use before they can reuse an old PIN. You can set the value of this setting between 1 and 20. For most organizations, this value should be set to 5 PINs, which is the default. Setting this value too high can frustrate users because it can be difficult for users to create and memorize many PINs. Setting it too low may introduce a security threat to your network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PIN recycle count can't be disabled.

For additional tasks related to Outlook Voice Access PIN security, see [PIN security procedures](pin-security-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to change the PIN recycle count

2. In the list view, select the dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM dial plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

4. Click **PIN policies**, and next to **PIN recycle count**, enter a value between 1 and 20.

5. Click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to change the PIN recycle count

This example sets the PIN recycle count on the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` to 10.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -PINHistoryCount 10
```
