# Authorize calls for a group of users in Exchange Online

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. You can use dialing authorizations on a mailbox policy to prohibit authenticated Outlook Voice Access users that are linked to the UM mailbox policy from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan. When you configure a setting on a UM mailbox policy, that setting applies to all UM-enabled users linked with the UM mailbox policy.

For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/create-um-mailbox-policy.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that in-country/region and international dialing rules have been created on a UM dial plan. For detailed steps, see [Create dialing rules for users](create-dialing-rules.md).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable in-country/region and international dialing authorizations on a UM mailbox policy

This example enables the InCountry/RegionGroup1, InCountry/RegionGroup2, InternationalGroup1, and InternationalGroup2 dialing authorizations on a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -Identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowedInCountryOrRegionGroups InCountry/RegionGroup1,InCountry/RegionGroup2 -AllowedInternationalGroups InternationalGroup1,InternationalGroup2
```
