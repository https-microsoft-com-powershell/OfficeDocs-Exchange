# Prevent users in the same dial plan from receiving faxes in Exchange Online

You can prevent UM-enabled users who are linked with a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan from receiving fax messages. By default, users who are enabled for Unified Messaging and are linked with a UM dial plan can receive fax messages. However, there may be times when you want to prevent users who are associated with a specific UM dial plan from receiving faxes.

You can prevent UM-enabled users from receiving faxes by configuring the UM dial plan, the UM mailbox policy, or the UM-enabled user's mailbox. If you disable incoming fax message delivery on a UM dial plan, all users who are associated with the dial plan will be prevented from receiving fax messages. Enabling or disabling faxing on a UM dial plan takes precedence over the settings for an individual UM-enabled user.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the EAC to configure fax settings on a UM mailbox policy. However, you must use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure fax settings on dial plans or for individual users.

For more information about fax partners, see [Microsoft solution providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/).

For additional management tasks related to faxing, see [Faxing procedures](faxing-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to prevent users who are linked to a dial plan from receiving faxes

This example prevents UM-enabled users associated with the UM dial plan named `MyUMDialPlan` from receiving faxes.

```PowerShell
Set-UMDialPlan -Identity MyUMDialPlan -FaxEnabled $false
```
