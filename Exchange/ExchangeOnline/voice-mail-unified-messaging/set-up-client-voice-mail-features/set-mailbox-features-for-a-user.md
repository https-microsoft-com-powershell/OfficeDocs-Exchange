# Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user in Exchange Online

Telephone user interface (TUI) settings are used when a user accesses the Unified Messaging (UM) system by using Outlook Voice Access. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI configuration settings, you modify properties and their values on the UM-enabled user's mailbox.

You can change the following TUI settings for a UM-enabled user:

- Allow subscriber access

- Allow TUI access to the calendar

- Allow TUI access to email

- Allow Automatic Speech Recognition

For additional management tasks related to UM users, see [Set mailbox features for an Outlook Voice Access user](set-mailbox-features-for-a-user.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that the existing Exchange recipient is enabled for Unified Messaging and voice mail. For detailed steps, see [Enable a user for voice mail](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/enable-a-user-for-voice-mail.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/create-um-dial-plan.md).

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/create-um-mailbox-policy.md).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Online](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/msonline/home?forum=onlineservicesexchange) or [Exchange Online Protection](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/forefront/home?forum=FOPE).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to modify a single UM-enabled user's TUI settings

This example enables calendar and email access using the TUI for a UM-enabled user named Tony Smith.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailbox -Identity tony@contoso.com TUIAccessToCal True -TUIAccessToEmail True -OperatorNumber 111111 -DisableMissedCallNotification False -AnonCallBlock True
```

> [!NOTE]
> TUI settings for users are also available on UM mailbox policies. Modifying TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy affects all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. For more information about how to modify TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, see [Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users](set-mailbox-features-for-users.md).
