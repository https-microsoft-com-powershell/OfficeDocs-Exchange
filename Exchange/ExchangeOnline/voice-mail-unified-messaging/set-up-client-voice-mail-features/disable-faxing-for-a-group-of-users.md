# Disable faxing for a group of users in Exchange Online

You can disable inbound faxes for users associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. By default, when you enable users for Unified Messaging, users can't receive fax messages until you specify the URI for the fax partner server , deploy a fax partner server for your organization, and enable faxing on a UM mailbox policy. If the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on the UM dial plan, the users linked with the UM mailbox policy still won't be able to receive faxes. Similarly, if the option to allow incoming faxes is disabled on an individual user, that user won't be able to receive faxes.

For more information about fax partners, see [Microsoft solution providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/).

For additional management tasks related to faxing, see [Faxing procedures](faxing-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to disable inbound faxing

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

2. On the **UM dial plan** page, under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the mailbox policy you want to modify, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM mailbox policy** page \> **General**, clear the check box next to **Allow inbound faxes**.

4. Click **Save** to save your changes.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to disable inbound faxing

This example prevents users who are linked with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` from using inbound faxing.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowFax $false
```
