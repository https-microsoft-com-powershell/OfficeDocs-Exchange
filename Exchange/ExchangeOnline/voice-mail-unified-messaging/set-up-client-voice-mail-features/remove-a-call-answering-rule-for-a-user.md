# Remove a call answering rule for a user in Exchange Online

You can use Exchange Online PowerShell to remove one or more call answering rules for a user. You can also use the **Remove-UMCallAnsweringRule** cmdlet in a PowerShell script to remove one or more call answering rules for multiple users.

Call answering rules are applied to incoming calls similar to the way Inbox rules are applied to incoming email messages. By default, when a user is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM), no call answering rules are configured. Even so, incoming calls are answered by the mail system and callers are prompted to leave a voice message.

> [!NOTE]
> Users that are UM-enabled can sign in to Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to create, manage, and remove call answering rules.

For additional management tasks related to Call Answering Rules, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures.md).
