2. Under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to manage, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM Mailbox Policy** page, select or clear the check box next to **Allow Outlook Voice Access**.

4. Click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Outlook Voice Access

This example allows users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` to use Outlook Voice Access.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowSubscriberAccess $true
```

This example prevents users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` from using Outlook Voice Access.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowSubscriberAccess $false
```
