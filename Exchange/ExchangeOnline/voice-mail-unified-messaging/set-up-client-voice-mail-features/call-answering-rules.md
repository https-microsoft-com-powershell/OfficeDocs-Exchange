# Call answering rules in Exchange Online

You can specify whether you want individual users to be able to create and manage their own call answering rules by configuring their mailbox properties. By default, they can create call answering rules.

You can enable or disable Call Answering Rules for multiple users that are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) by configuring Call Answering Rules on a UM dial plan or UM mailbox policy.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the EAC to configure this feature. You must use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Call Answering Rules for a voice mail user.

For additional management tasks related to allowing users to forward calls, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/create-um-dial-plan.md).

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that a UM mailbox policy has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM mailbox policy](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/create-um-mailbox-policy.md).

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that the user's mailbox has been UM-enabled. For detailed steps, see [Enable a user for voice mail](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/enable-a-user-for-voice-mail.md).
