# Call answering rules in the same mailbox policy in Exchange Online

You can allow users who are associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy to configure call answering rules, or prevent them from doing so. If the option to configure call answering rules is disabled on a UM dial plan, the Call Answering Rules feature won't be available to UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy. The default setting is enabled.

For additional management tasks related to allowing users to forward calls, see [Forwarding calls procedures](forwarding-calls-procedures.md).

2. Under **UM Mailbox Policies**, select the UM mailbox policy you want to manage, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

3. On the **UM Mailbox Policy** page, select or clear the check box next to **Allow users to configure call answering rules**.

4. Click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable call answering rules on a UM mailbox policy

This example allows users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` to create call answering rules.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowCallAnsweringRules $true
```

This example prevents users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy `MyUMMailboxPolicy` from creating call answering rules.

```PowerShell
Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity MyUMMailboxPolicy -AllowCallAnsweringRules $false
```
