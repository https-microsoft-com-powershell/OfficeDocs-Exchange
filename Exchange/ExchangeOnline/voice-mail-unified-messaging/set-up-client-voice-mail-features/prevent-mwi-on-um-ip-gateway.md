# Prevent Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) on a UM IP gateway in Exchange Online

You can prevent voice mail notifications to users for calls received by a Unified Messaging (UM) IP gateway. If you enable this setting, the UM IP gateway can receive and send SIP NOTIFY messages for users. Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) is enabled by default and allows message waiting notifications to be sent to users, but you can turn it off depending on your needs.

A message waiting indicator notifies a user about a new or unheard voice message. It appears in the Inbox in clients such as Outlook and Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). It can also be a text (SMS) message sent to a registered mobile phone, an outgoing call made from an Exchange server to a number that's been configured for playing new messages, or a lighted lamp on a user's desktop phone.

> [!TIP]
> MWI notifications can also be enabled and disabled on a UM mailbox policy for a group of users.

For additional management tasks related to UM IP gateways, see [UM IP gateway procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/um-ip-gateway-procedures.md).

## Use the EAC to prevent Message Waiting Indicator

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM IP Gateways**, select the UM IP gateway you want to change, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

2. On the **UM IP Gateway** page, clear the check box next to **Allow message waiting indicator**.

3. Click **Save**.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to prevent Message Waiting Indicator

This example prevents the message waiting indicator from appearing for users who are associated with the UM IP gateway named `MyUMIPGateway` with an IP address of 10.10.10.1.

```PowerShell
Set-UMIPGateway -Identity MyUMIPGateway -Address 10.10.10.1 -MessageWaitingIndicatorAllowed $false
```
