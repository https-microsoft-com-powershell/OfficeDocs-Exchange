# Navigating menus with Outlook Voice Access in Exchange Online

Outlook Voice Access is a feature in Unified Messaging (UM) that enables users to retrieve email and voice mail messages and manage their calendar and personal contacts by using an analog, digital, or mobile telephone. They can interact with their mailbox using their telephone keypad or voice commands, but must use the keypad on their telephone to search for a user in the directory for your organization.

When UM-enabled users call in to an Outlook Voice Access number, they can sign in to their mailbox using a telephone and are presented with a series of voice prompts. These voice prompts help them navigate the voice mail system menus and enable them to access their mailbox. Outlook Voice Access lets users do the following:

- Retrieve, listen to, reply to, create, and forward voice or email messages.

- Listen to or change calendar information.

- Change personal options, such as a PIN, or call or send a voice message to a personal contact.

An Outlook Voice Access number is assigned to a user when they're enabled for UM. The user can find an Outlook Voice Access number to access their mailbox in the welcome message that's sent to them when they're enabled for UM or by signing in to their mailbox using Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App), going to **Options** \> **Telephone**, and locating the Outlook Voice Access number or numbers in the **Outlook Voice Access** section.

After a user enters their extension number and PIN, the voice mail system will let them know how many new voice mail and email messages they have and when their next meeting is. After the voice mail system has played this prompt, an Outlook Voice Access main menu will be read to the user and the user can say one of the following:

- Voice mail

- Email

- Calendar

- Personal options

## Reading and reviewing email

Users can listen to, reply to, create, and forward unread email messages using the telephone. For example, if a user is expecting an important email message, and does not have access to the internet, they can use a mobile telephone to dial an Outlook Voice Access number.

### Listen to email messages

To listen to email messages using their voice, the user must dial an Outlook Voice Access number, enter their extension number and PIN, and then do the following:

1. Say "Email" to access their email.

2. The voice mail system will read the name, subject, time, and priority of the first unread email message.

3. The user can then say one of the following options:

   - "Next message" to mark the message as Read and go to the next email message.

   - "Mark unread" to keep the message marked as Unread and go to the next message.

   - "End" to jump to the end of the message.

   - "Delete" to delete the message.

## Managing calendar meetings and appointments
<a name="managecalendaritems"> </a>

Users can listen to, reply to, create, and forward meeting requests and appointments in their calendar over the telephone.

For example, a user has a meeting at 10:00 A.M. However, because of some unexpected delays, the user will be 15 minutes late. The user can inform the other meeting attendees by calling the telephone number for Outlook Voice Access, signing in to their mailbox, and then accessing the list of meetings for that day in the calendar. After the voice mail system reads the meeting request for the 10:00 A.M. meeting, the user can use the I'll be late feature to inform all the meeting attendees that the user will be 15 minutes late. Each attendee will receive an email message that informs them that the user will be 15 minutes late. The user also has the option to attach a voice mail message.

In another example, a user may have an important client who decides to schedule an all-day meeting on very short notice. The user must cancel all other meetings for that day in the simplest possible way. Using the Clear my calendar feature, users can quickly and easily clear their calendar for the whole day.

Users can manage their personal options and contacts using Outlook Voice Access. They can:

- Call a personal contact.

- Locate and call a user in the directory.

- Configure personal options, such as changing their PIN over the telephone.

When users first set up their mailbox, they must create personal and Automatic Replies greetings that callers will hear when users are unable to answer their telephone. If, for example, users realize that they have forgotten to turn on an Automatic Replies voice greeting that will give callers an alternative number to call if they have an immediate issue, users can use Outlook Voice Access to access their personal options and record and turn on an Automatic Replies greeting from any telephone.

If a user has to contact an account manager with important information about a client, the user can call the number that is used for Outlook Voice Access, use the directory search feature using their telephone keypad to locate the account manager, and then place the call.
