# Configure the number of sign-in failures before Outlook Voice Access users are disconnected in Exchange Online

You can specify the number of sequential unsuccessful sign-in attempts that are allowed before a caller is disconnected. The value of this setting can be from 1 through 20. Setting this value too low can frustrate users. For most organizations, this value should be set to the default of three attempts.

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the number of sign-in failures before users are disconnected

```
