# Set mailbox features for Outlook Voice Access users in Exchange Online

Outlook Voice Access contains two interfaces: a telephone user interface (TUI) and a voice user interface (VUI). You can configure a UM-enabled user's TUI settings when the user accesses a mailbox using the Unified Messaging (UM) system in Exchange Server. When you modify a UM-enabled user's TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy, the changes affect all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. You can modify the following TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy:

- PIN-less access to voice mail

- Voice responses to other messages

- TUI access to their calendar

- TUI access to the directory

- TUI access to their email

- TUI access to their personal contacts

> [!NOTE]
> You can use only Exchange Online PowerShell to modify the Outlook Voice Access TUI settings for UM-enabled users.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to modify TUI settings on a UM mailbox policy

This example sets TUI-related settings on a UM mailbox policy named `MyUMMailboxPolicy`.

```
