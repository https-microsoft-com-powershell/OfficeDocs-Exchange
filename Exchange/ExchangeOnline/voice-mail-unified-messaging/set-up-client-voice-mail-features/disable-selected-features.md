# Disable selected features for Outlook Voice Access users in Exchange Online

Outlook Voice Access contains two interfaces: the telephone user interface (TUI) and the voice user interface (VUI). By default, when users dial in to Outlook Voice Access, they can access their calendar, email, and personal contacts, and search the directory. You can use Exchange Online PowerShell to prevent users from accessing one or more of these features when they use Outlook Voice Access to access their mailbox. When you modify Outlook Voice Access features on a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy, your changes affect all users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy.

You can disable users' access to the following Outlook Voice Access features on a UM mailbox policy:

- Calendar

- Directory

- Email

- Personal contacts

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).

You can also use Exchange Online PowerShell to disable Outlook Voice Access features on the mailbox of a single UM-enabled user. When you do this, the features will be disabled only for that user. Although you can't disable all the Outlook Voice Access features that are found on a UM mailbox policy for a single user, you can disable access to their calendar and to their email.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailboxes, see [Voice mail for users](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/voice-mail-for-users.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use only Exchange Online PowerShell to modify the Outlook Voice Access features for UM-enabled users on a UM mailbox policy or on the mailbox of a single UM-enabled user.
