# Configure an Outlook Voice Access number in Exchange Online

An Outlook Voice Access number lets a user who is enabled for Unified Messaging (UM) and voice mail access their mailbox using Outlook Voice Access. When you configure an Outlook Voice Access or subscriber access number on a dial plan, UM-enabled users can call in to the number, sign in to their mailbox, and access their email, voice mail, calendar, and personal contact information.

By default, when you create a UM dial plan, an Outlook Voice Access number isn't configured. To configure an Outlook Voice Access number, you first need to create the dial plan, and then configure an Outlook Voice Access number under the dial plan's **Outlook Voice Access** option. Although an Outlook Voice Access number isn't required, you need to configure at least one Outlook Voice Access number to enable a UM-enabled user to use Outlook Voice Access to access their mailbox. You can configure multiple Outlook Voice Access numbers for a single dial plan.

Outlook Voice Access numbers can contain alphabetical, numeric, and special characters, separators, and spaces. For example:

- +14255551010

- +1-425-555-1010

- 4255551010

- +1 425 555 1010

- 1-800-555-CALL

For more information about the menu options available for Outlook Voice Access users, see the Quick Reference Guide for Outlook Voice Access, which is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17369).

For additional management tasks related to UM dial plans, see [UM dial plan procedures in Exchange Online](../connect-voice-mail-system/um-dial-plan-procedures.md).
