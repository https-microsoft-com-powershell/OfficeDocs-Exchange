Dialing authorizations on a dial plan are used to prohibit unauthenticated Outlook Voice Access users from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan.

# Authorize calls for users in a dial plan in Exchange Online

You can enable dialing authorizations on a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan. Dialing authorizations on a dial plan are used to prohibit unauthenticated Outlook Voice Access users from making in-country/region or international telephone calls, or outdialing. Outdialing happens when Unified Messaging places an outgoing call for a user after they've called in to an Outlook Voice Access phone number that is configured on a UM dial plan. When you configure a setting on a UM dial plan, that setting applies to all unauthenticated users that call in to an Outlook Voice Access number.

For additional management tasks related to outdialing, see [Allowing users to make calls procedures](allow-users-to-make-calls-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md)) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/create-um-dial-plan.md).

- Before you perform this procedure, confirm that in-country/region and international dialing rules have been created on a UM dial plan. For detailed steps, see [Create dialing rules for users](create-dialing-rules.md).

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to enable in-country/region and international dialing authorizations on a UM dial plan

```PowerShell
Set-UMDialPlan -Identity MyUMDialPlan -AllowedInCountryOrRegionGroups InCountry/RegionGroup1,InCountry/RegionGroup2 -AllowedInternationalGroups InternationalGroup1,InternationalGroup2
```
