You can disable the Voice Mail Preview feature for users associated with a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy. Disabling this setting prevents users from receiving the text of a voice mail message in the message body of an email or text message. The default setting is enabled.

For additional management tasks related to UM mailbox policies, see [UM mailbox policy procedures](../../voice-mail-unified-messaging/set-up-voice-mail/um-mailbox-policy-procedures.md).

```
