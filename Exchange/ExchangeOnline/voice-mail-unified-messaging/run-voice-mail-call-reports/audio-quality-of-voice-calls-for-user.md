# Investigate the audio quality of voice calls for a user in Exchange Online

If a user reports problems with the audio quality of their Unified Messaging (UM) calls, you can use the User Call Logs report to help you understand what's causing the problems.

> [!NOTE]
> The audio quality of a call can be affected by factors that aren't covered in the reports. For example, if your Exchange servers are experiencing a heavy memory or CPU load, users may report poor call quality, even though the reports show excellent audio quality.

For additional tasks related to UM reports, see [UM reports procedures](um-reports-procedures.md)

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

> [!TIP]
> Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at [Exchange Online](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/msonline/home?forum=onlineservicesexchange) or [Exchange Online Protection](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/forefront/home?forum=FOPE).

## Use the EAC to get call logs for a UM-enabled user

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **More options** ![More Options Icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_MoreOptionsIcon.gif) \> **User call logs**.

2. Click **Select a user**, and then select the user you want data for.

3. To get more details about the audio quality for a row in the report, select the row and click **Audio Quality Details**. The following information is available:

   - **DATE AND TIME**: The date and time of the call, in the time zone that the selected user has set in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App).

   - **USER**: The selected user.

   - **UM DIAL PLAN**: The dial plan for the call.

   - **UM IP GATEWAY**: The UM IP gateway that was used for the call.

   - **AUDIO CODEC**: The audio codec that was used during the call.

   - **NMOS**: The Network Mean Opinion Score (NMOS) for the call. The NMOS indicates how good the audio quality was on the call as a number on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being excellent.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The maximum NMOS possible for a call depends on the audio codec being used. The NMOS may not be available for very short calls that are less than 10 seconds long.

   - **NMOS DEGRADATION**: The amount of audio degradation of the NMOS from the top value possible for the audio codec being used. For example, if the NMOS degradation value for a call was 1.2 and the NMOS reported for the call was 3.3, the maximum NMOS for that particular call would be 4.5 (1.2 + 3.3).

   - **JITTER**: The average variation in the arrival of data packets for the call.

   - **PACKET LOSS**: The average percentage of data packet loss for the selected call. Packet loss is an indication of the reliability of the connection.

   - **ROUND TRIP**: The average round trip score, in milliseconds, for audio on the selected call. The round-trip score measures latency on the connection.

   - **BURST LOSS DURATION**: The average duration of packet loss during bursts of losses for the selected call.
