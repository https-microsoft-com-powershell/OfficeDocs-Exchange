# Enable a UM IP gateway in Exchange Online

By default, when a Unified Messaging (UM) IP gateway is created, its status is set to enabled. However, you might need to disable the UM IP gateway to take it offline and not allow it to take incoming or outgoing calls. After you create a UM IP gateway, you can control its operation and functionality by setting its status variable to enabled or disabled.

 For additional management tasks related to UM IP gateways, see [UM IP gateway procedures](um-ip-gateway-procedures.md).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: Less than 1 minute.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Unified Messaging" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- Before you perform these procedures, confirm that a UM dial plan has been created. For detailed steps, see [Create a UM dial plan](create-um-dial-plan.md).
