# Delete a UM hunt group in Exchange Online

After you delete a Unified Messaging (UM) hunt group, the UM IP gateway associated with the UM hunt group will no longer service or answer incoming calls.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you want to change the UM hunt group settings, you must delete the hunt group and then create another hunt group that has the appropriate settings.
