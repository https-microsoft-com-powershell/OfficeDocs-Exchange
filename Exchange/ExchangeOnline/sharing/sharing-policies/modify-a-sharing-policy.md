## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to modify, disable or remove a sharing policy
<a name="BKMK_Shell"> </a>

- This example modifies the sharing policy Contoso. This policy allows users in the Contoso domain to see simple free/busy information.

  ```PowerShell
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'sales.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple'
  ```

- This example adds a second domain to the sharing policy Contoso. When you're adding a domain to an existing policy, you must include any previously included domains.

  ```PowerShell
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Domains 'contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple', 'atlanta.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer', 'beijing.contoso.com: CalendarSharingFreeBusyReviewer'
  ```

- This example sets the sharing policy Contoso as the default sharing policy.

  ```PowerShell
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Default $True
  ```

- This example disables the sharing policy Contoso.

  ```PowerShell
  Set-SharingPolicy -Identity "Contoso" -Enabled $False
  ```

- The first example removes the sharing policy Contoso. The second example removes the sharing policy Contoso and suppresses the confirmation that you want to remove the policy.

  ```PowerShell
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Remove-SharingPolicy -Identity Contoso -Confirm

  ```
