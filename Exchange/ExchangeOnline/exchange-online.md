## To manage Exchange Online

As an administrator for your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization, you manage your organization's Exchange Online service in the Exchange admin center. Here's how you get there:

1. [Sign in](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4) to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 using your work or school account, and then choose the **Admin** tile.
2. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, choose **Admin centers** \> **Exchange**.

   For an introduction, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](exchange-admin-center.md).

Exchange admin center is now available at the new URL address [https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com). This is a modern, web-based management console for managing Exchange that is designed to provide an experience more in line with the overall Microsoft 365 admin experience.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still access the [Classic Exchange admin center](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp) and sign in using your credentials.
