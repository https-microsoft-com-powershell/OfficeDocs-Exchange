# Enable or disable Outlook on the web for a mailbox

You can use the EAC or Exchange Online PowerShell to enable or disable Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) for a user mailbox. When Outlook on the web is enabled, a user can use Outlook on the web to send and receive email. When Outlook on the web is disabled, the mailbox will continue to receive email messages, and a user can access it to send and receive email by using a MAPI client, such as Microsoft Outlook, or with a POP or IMAP email client, assuming that the mailbox is enabled to support access by those clients.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Outlook on the web and MAPI, POP3, and IMAP4 email clients is enabled by default when a user mailbox is created.

For additional management tasks related to managing email client access to a mailbox, see the following topics:

- [Enable or disable MAPI for a mailbox](enable-or-disable-mapi.md)

- [Enable or Disable POP3 or IMAP4 access for a user](../../clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/pop3-and-imap4/enable-or-disable-pop3-or-imap4-access.md)

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 2 minutes.

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Client Access user settings" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

```

This example enables Outlook on the web for the mailbox of Elly Nkya.

```PowerShell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity "Elly Nkya" -OWAEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-casmailbox).

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled Outlook on the web for a user mailbox, do one of the following:

- Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell.

  If Outlook on the web is enabled, the value for the _OWAEnabled_ property is `True`. If Outlook on the web is disabled, the value is `False`.
