# Manage Facebook contact sync in your organization

Facebook contact synchronization lets people set up a connection between their Facebook account and their Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account by using Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). After they set up a Facebook connection, all their Facebook friends are listed as contacts in People in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. They can then interact with their Facebook friends as they do with their other contacts. Facebook contact sync is turned on by default if the feature is available in your region.

> [!TIP]
> 
> - As an administrator, you probably want to keep Facebook contact sync turned on if your organization uses Facebook for business purposes, such as networking and marketing. Turn it off if you don't want your users to download their Facebook friends as contacts in Outlook on the web. For information about how people set up Facebook contact sync, see [Manage Facebook contact sync in your organization](manage-facebook-contact-sync.md).
> 
> - The features that are available to your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization are determined by the service plan for your account. Some features aren't available to mailboxes or organizations in specific regions.

## Turn Facebook contact sync on or off

You turn Facebook contact sync on or off for users in your organization by using Outlook on the web mailbox policy (formerly known as Outlook Web App mailbox policy) settings. Similar to other Outlook on the web mailbox policy settings, you can change the settings for Facebook contact sync by using the Exchange admin center (EAC) or Exchange Online PowerShell. For detailed information about managing Outlook on the web mailbox policy settings, see [View or configure Outlook on the web mailbox policy properties](../clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-on-the-web/configure-outlook-web-app-mailbox-policy-properties.md).

## For more information

The information for each Facebook friend is stored as a read-only contact record in the Facebook folder in People. The information that's synchronized between Facebook and Outlook on the web includes first name, last name, all phone numbers, all email addresses, and all street addresses. Facebook contacts are stored in the user's mailbox and are retained in accordance with the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service agreement.

During the Outlook on the web and Facebook connection setup, the contacts in the user's default contacts folder are uploaded to Facebook as part of a one-time synchronization with Facebook. Facebook uses this contact information as part of the "People you may know" friend suggestions on Facebook. The one-time upload of information also allows Facebook to include the information for your users' Outlook on the web contacts in Facebook applications that your users may choose to use, for example, mobile phone applications.

For information about how your users can set up a connection to Facebook using a desktop version of Outlook, see [Social Connector for Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/255447e8-82cd-48e7-9b79-1dd8721a2907).
