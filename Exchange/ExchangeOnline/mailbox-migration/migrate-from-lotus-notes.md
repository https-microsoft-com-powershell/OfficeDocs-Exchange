# Migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft 365 or Office 365

When planning to migrate email from IBM Lotus Notes to Microsoft 365 or Office 365, use the **Microsoft Online Notes Inspector (MONTI)** application. This tool will assist you in evaluating the amount data to be migrated from a customer's Lotus Notes environment to Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

Here's what MONTI does:

- It processes mail files to determine the total database size, document count (calendar, contacts, groups, mail, and tasks), and size by days.

- It processes Mail-In Databases to determine the total database size, and Size by Days.

- It posts results under the People, Mail-In Databases, and Logs views. You can create these reports manually or on a scheduled basis.

Download the [MONTI application and accompanying documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=29567) from the Microsoft Download Center.

To directly download only the application:  [MONTI application](https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/F/D/FFD6C34A-C9DB-4BE5-8504-2F912AB820C3/MONTI.exe.) 

The documentation describes how to deploy, configure, and run the MONTI application in a customer's Domino environment.
