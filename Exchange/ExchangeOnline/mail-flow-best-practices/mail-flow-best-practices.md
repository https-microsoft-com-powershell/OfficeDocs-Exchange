# Mail flow best practices for Exchange Online, Microsoft 365, and Office 365 (overview)

Use Microsoft Exchange Online and Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to manage mail flow. Find out how, and get tips and best practices for setting up and managing your email.

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 give you flexibility in determining the best arrangement for how email is delivered to your organization's mailboxes. The path email takes from the internet to a mailbox and vice versa is called mail flow. Most organizations want Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to manage all their mailboxes and filtering, and some organizations need more complex mail flow setups to make sure that they comply with specific regulatory or business needs. If you're part of a small business or simply an organization that wants Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to manage all your mailboxes and mail flow, we recommend following the steps in [Set up Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/setup). That article provides a complete checklist for setting up Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services and programs, including how to set up your mail flow and email clients.

For information about how your email is protected with EOP, see [Exchange Online Protection Overview](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/exchange-online-protection-overview).

Check out the [External Domain Name System records for Microsoft 365 or Office 365](/office365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records) topic. We especially recommend reading the part about SPF records because customers often list the wrong values in their SPF record, which can cause mail flow problems.

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 mail flow covers the following scenarios:

## Introduction to the basics of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 mail flow

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 use domains, like contoso.com, to route email messages. When you set up email in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you typically switch from the default domain that you got when you first signed up for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 (the domain ending with .onmicrosoft.com) to your organization's domain. Domain names, like contoso.com, are managed by using a worldwide system of domain registrars (for example, GoDaddy, HostGator, or Moniker) and databases called the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS provides a mapping between human-readable computer hostnames and the IP addresses used by networking equipment. If you're new to DNS, we recommend that you read [DNS basics](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/dns-basics). The following video provides you with a quick overview of some of the most important concepts about what DNS is and how it works.

### Understanding how DNS records control mail flow

In Microsoft 365 and Office 365 mail flow, there are several components of DNS that are particularly important for email authentication and delivery: MX records, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

 **MX (mail exchanger) records** provide an easy way for mail servers to know where to send email. You can think of the MX record as a type of postal address. If you want Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to receive all email addressed to anyone@contoso.com, the MX record for contoso.com should point to Microsoft 365 or Office 365, and it will look like the following example:

```
Hostname: contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
Priority: 0
TTL: 1 hour
```

 **SPF (sender policy framework)** is a specially formatted TXT record in DNS. SPF validates that only the organization that owns a domain is actually sending email from that domain. SPF is a security measure that helps makes sure someone doesn't impersonate another organization. This impersonation is often called spoofing. As a domain owner, you can use SPF to publish a list of IP addresses or subnets that are authorized to send email on your organization's behalf. This can be helpful if you want to send email from multiple servers or services with different IP addresses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only have one SPF record per domain. Having multiple SPF records will invalidate all SPF records and cause mail flow problems.

Because most modern email servers look up a domain's SPF record before they accept any email from it, it's important to set up a valid SPF record in DNS when you first set up mail flow. For a quick introduction to SPF and to get it configured quickly, see [Set up SPF in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to help prevent spoofing](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing). For a more in-depth understanding of how Microsoft 365 and Office 365 use SPF, or for troubleshooting or non-standard deployments such as hybrid deployments, start with [How Microsoft 365 and Office 365 use Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to prevent spoofing](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-office-365-uses-spf-to-prevent-spoofing).

**DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).** lets you attach a digital signature to email messages in the message header of emails you send. Email systems that receive email from your domain use this digital signature to determine if incoming email that they receive is legitimate. For information about DKIM and Microsoft 365 or Office 365, see [Use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your domain in Microsoft 365 or Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email).

**Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC).** helps receiving mail systems determine what to do with messages that fail SPF or DKIM checks and provides another level of trust for your email partners. For information on setting up DMARC, see [Use DMARC to validate email in Microsoft 365 or Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dmarc-to-validate-email).

Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC together for the best experience.

### How MX records affect spam filtering

For the best mail flow experience (especially for spam filtering) we recommend pointing the MX record for your organization's domain to Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Spam scanning is the initial connection point to the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service. Who is sending the message, the IP address of the server that originally sent the message, and the behavior of the connecting mail server, all help determine whether a message is legitimate or spam. If your domain's MX record doesn't point to Microsoft 365 or Office 365, the spam filters won't be as effective. If your MX record doesn't point to Microsoft 365 or Office 365, there will be some valid messages that the service misclassifies as spam and some spam messages that the service misclassifies as legitimate email.

With that said, there are legitimate business scenarios that require your domain's MX record to point to somewhere other than Microsoft 365 or Office 365. For example, email destined for your organization might need to initially arrive at another destination (such as a third-party archiving solution), then route through Microsoft 365 or Office 365, and then be delivered to mailboxes on your organization's mail server. This setup might provide the best solution to meet your business requirements.

Whatever your needs, this guide will help you understand how your MX records, SPF, and, potentially, connectors need to be set up.
