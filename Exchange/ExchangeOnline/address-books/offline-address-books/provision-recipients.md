# Provision recipients for offline address book downloads in Exchange Online

If you use multiple offline address books (OABs) in your organization, you have have only one option for assigning the OAB to users:

- **Per address book policy**: You can assign an address book policy (ABP) to a user, and the ABP specifies the OAB. If you assign an ABP to a user that already has an OAB assigned to their mailbox, the OAB that's assigned to the mailbox will take precedence. For more information, see [Assign an address book policy to mail users](../../address-books/address-book-policies/assign-an-address-book-policy-to-mail-users.md).

For additional management tasks related to OABs, see [Offline address book procedures](offline-address-book-procedures.md).
