# Use a screen reader to manage anti-spam protection in Exchange Online

Exchange Online includes spam filtering capabilities that help protect your network from spam transferred through email. Administrators do not need to set up or maintain these filtering technologies, which are enabled by default. However, administrators can make company-specific filtering customizations in the Exchange admin center (EAC), all using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about protecting your organization from spam in Exchange Online, go to [Anti-spam and anti-malware protection in EOP](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-spam-and-anti-malware-protection).

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started. For more information about the EAC, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](../exchange-admin-center.md).

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

To complete the tasks covered in this topic, see [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 global administrator has assigned you to the Organization Management and Hygiene Management admin role groups.
