Microsoft wants to provide the best possible experience for all customers, including customers with disabilities. This article contains links to articles written for people who use the screen reader JAWS from Freedom Scientific or who use Narrator, the screen reader built-in to Windows 10.

These articles provide help that depends only on specified keyboard shortcuts and a screen reader.
