# Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

The Exchange admin center (EAC) is a web-based app that lets you manage your Exchange Online organization in a web browser. Using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts, you can open the EAC and perform administrative tasks (based on your permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> When you work in the EAC, we recommend that you use Internet Explorer as your web browser. For more information about the keyboard shortcuts you can use to navigate the EAC and about other accessibility features that are available for Exchange Online, see [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/15363/) and [Accessibility in Exchange Online](accessibility.md).
