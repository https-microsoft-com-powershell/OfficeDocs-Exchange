# Accessibility in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

The Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online includes accessibility features that make it easy for users with limited dexterity, low vision, or other disabilities to work with files. This means you can use keyboard shortcuts, a screen reader, or a speech recognition tool to work with the EAC.

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started. For more information about the EAC, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](../exchange-admin-center.md).

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016.

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/15363/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Microsoft 365 or Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) and [Exchange Online Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

[Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md)[Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your global administrator has assigned you to any admin role group, for example, Organization Management. You know you are assigned to at least one admin role group if you can open the EAC. Learn how to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-identify-admin-role-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

## Explore the EAC user interface

The EAC user interface exists within your web browser as part of Exchange Online. Within that window, "Office 365 Admin" shows in the title bar. At the left edge of the title bar is the app launcher that contains the list of Microsoft services and Microsoft 365 or Office applications, including Mail (Outlook.com), Excel, OneNote, and more. On the right side of the title bar are commands to get notifications, manage your options, get help, and sign out.

Under the title bar is the name, "Exchange admin center." The left pane lists about a dozen Exchange administrative categories, for example, **dashboard**, **permissions**, and **mail flow**. By default, dashboard has the focus.

The administrative category selected in the left feature pane affects the content of the main window to its right. For example, when you select **dashboard** in the left pane, all administrative categories display in the main window list view, along with their subcategories. Likewise, when you select **recipients** in the left feature pane, a list of all user mailbox names and addresses appears in the main window list view.

When you select an item in the main window list view, often a right pane presents a details view about that item. For example, when you select the **permissions** administrative category in the left features pane, a list of admin roles appears in the main window list view, and the first admin role, **Compliance Management**, has the focus. Information about Compliance Management appears in the right pane details view.

Across the top of the main window list view, a set of menu tabs appears which lists subcategories for the administrative category that has the focus. For example, when you select **protection** in the left feature pane, menu tabs, such as **malware filter** and **spam filter**, appear across the top of the main window. In addition, sometimes a toolbar appears, with commands such as **New**, **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Refresh**.

The bottom of the main window is a status bar which indicates how many records are selected.

## Use a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts

The EAC includes accessible names that can be read by a screen reader as you work in the application. You can use Narrator, the built-in screen reader in Windows, or a third-party screen reader, such as [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/JAWS/). For more information, refer to [Get started using a screen reader in the Exchange admin center](get-started-using-screen-reader.md). You can also use [Windows Speech Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14213) or a third-party speech tool to give voice commands to the EAC.

To navigate in the EAC and to cycle through groups of screen elements, press Ctrl+F6 (forward) or Ctrl+Shift+F6 (backward). To cycle through screen elements, including lists of items, press the Tab key (forward) or Shift+Tab (backward). To select an item, press Enter. To browse within menus or lists, press the Up Arrow key or the Down Arrow key, and then, to make a selection, press Enter. To exit a menu or mode, press Esc. For more details, go to [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

As you move around the areas of the EAC, your screen reader provides information about the area that has the focus, whether it's the left feature pane (you hear "Primary navigation, Link"), menu tabs, toolbar, main window list view (you hear "Secondary navigation"), or details view in the right pane (in Narrator, you hear the contents of the pane).
