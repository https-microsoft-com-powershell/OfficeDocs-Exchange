# Use a screen reader to define rules that encrypt or decrypt email messages in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

In the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online, you can create mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) to enable or disable Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Message Encryption. This lets you encrypt outgoing email messages and remove encryption from encrypted messages coming from inside your organization or from replies to encrypted messages sent from your organization.

 **Note**: To learn more about message encryption, go to [Encryption](/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption). Your organization must have [Set up new Message Encryption capabilities](/microsoft-365/compliance/set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities) to complete the tasks in this topic.

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan and admin role to perform this task. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

To complete the tasks covered in this topic, [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your global administrator has assigned you to the Organization Management and Records Management admin role groups.
