# Use a screen reader to configure voice mail in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

You can use your screen reader in the Exchange admin center (EAC) to specify options and enable voicemail and other voice features for Exchange Online users. Learn more about [voicemail in Exchange Online](../voice-mail-unified-messaging/voice-mail-unified-messaging.md).

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan and admin role to perform this task. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) and [Exchange Online Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

To configure voicemail in Exchange Online, [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your global administrator has assigned you to the Organization Management and UM Management admin role groups. Learn how to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-identify-admin-role-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

### Create and configure a UM dial plan

With Unified Messaging (UM) in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, administrators can manage voice messaging and email messaging from a single platform. Likewise, users can read or listen to their voicemail as well as email messages in their Inbox or use Outlook Voice Access from any telephone.

Before you configure voicemail for Exchange Online users, you or another admin must create and configure a UM dial plan; you can do both in the EAC. A UM dial plan contains configuration information related to your telephony network, and establishes a link from users' telephone extension numbers enabled for voicemail to their Outlook mailboxes. This configuration information includes extension length, dial plan protocol type, audio language, Outlook Voice Access, voicemail settings, dialing rules, and more. Learn how to [create a UM dial plan](../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/create-um-dial-plan.md)) and [manage a UM dial plan](../voice-mail-unified-messaging/connect-voice-mail-system/manage-um-dial-plan.md).
