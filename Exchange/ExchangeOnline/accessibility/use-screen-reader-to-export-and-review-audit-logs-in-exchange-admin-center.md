# Use a screen reader to export and review audit logs in the Exchange admin center

You can export and review mailbox audit logs by using your screen reader in the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online. When enabled, Exchange mailbox auditing logs information in the mailbox audit log whenever a user other than the owner accesses the mailbox. Each log entry includes information about who accessed the mailbox and the actions performed.

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan and admin role to perform this task. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) and [Exchange Online Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

To export and review mailbox audit logs, [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your global administrator has assigned you to the Organization Management and Records Management admin role groups. Learn how to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-identify-admin-role-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

### Configure mailbox audit logging

Before you can export and review audit logs, you or another admin must enable mailbox audit logging and configure Outlook to allow XML attachments. These tasks are done in Exchange Online PowerShell.

12. Tab to the **export** button and press Enter. Exchange retrieves entries in the mailbox audit log that meet your search criteria, saves them to a file named SearchResult.xml, and then attaches the XML file to an email message sent within 24 hours to your selected audit log recipients.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you hear an error message that says the items you're trying to open couldn't be found, check that audit logging is enabled for the selected mailboxes. Also check that the selected dates are within range. The dates need to be after the date audit logging was enabled, and, by default, within the past 90 days.

## Review a mailbox audit log

1. Open Outlook and sign in to your mailbox (or the mailbox where the audit log was sent).

2. In the Inbox, find and open the message sent by Exchange or Outlook with a subject including "Mailbox Audit Log Search" and an XML file attachment named SearchResult.xml. The body of the email message contains the search criteria for this exported audit log.

   > [!TIP]
   > If Outlook is not configured to allow XML attachments, you might receive the email message but not be able to open the XML attachment. Also, if you can't find the message, you might need to wait longer. Recipients typically receive the exported audit log within 24 hours, but in some cases it might take a few days.

3. Select the message attachment and specify that you want to download the XML file.

4. Open the SearchResult.xml file in Excel. Each log entry includes information about non-owners of the mailbox who accessed the mailbox and the actions performed. The following fields are included, among others, in the audit log:

|**This mailbox audit log field**|**Gives this information**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Owner|The owner of the mailbox accessed by a non-owner|
|LastAccessed|The date and time of the most recent mailbox access|
|Operation|The action performed by the non-owner|
|OperationResult|Whether the action performed by the non-owner succeeded or failed|
|LogonType|The type of non-owner access, like administrator, delegate, or external Microsoft datacenter administrator|
|ClientIPAddress|The IP address of the computer used by the non-owner to access the mailbox|
|LogonUserDN|The display name of the non-owner|
