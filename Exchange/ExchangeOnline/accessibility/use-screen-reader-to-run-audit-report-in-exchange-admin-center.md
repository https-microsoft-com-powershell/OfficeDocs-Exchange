# Use a screen reader to run an audit report in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

You can run audit reports and search for audit information by using your screen reader in the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online. Certain audit reports can help you troubleshoot configuration issues by tracking specific changes made by administrators. Other audit reports can help you monitor regulatory, compliance, and litigation requirements.

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) and [Exchange Online Service Description.](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

To run audit reports, [Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your global administrator has assigned you to the Organization Management and Records Management admin role groups. To run In-Place eDiscovery or In-Place Hold reports, check that you are assigned to the Discovery Management role group. Learn how to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-identify-admin-role-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

## Find data to troubleshoot configuration and security issues

Troubleshoot configuration issues by examining logged information about mailbox access by non-owners, Exchange Online configuration changes, and administrator role group updates. This information is available on the **Compliance Management** tab and the **Auditing** page of the EAC.

### Search for non-owner mailbox access

When Exchange mailbox auditing is enabled for a mailbox, information is recorded in the mailbox audit log whenever a user other than the owner accesses that mailbox. Each log entry includes information about who accessed the mailbox and what actions were performed. Search for non-owner mailbox access when you need to troubleshoot possible security issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can search for non-owner mailbox access, you or another Admin must enable mailbox audit logging, which is done in Exchange Online PowerShell. [Learn more about running a non-owner mailbox access report](../security-and-compliance/exchange-auditing-reports/non-owner-mailbox-access-report.md).
