# Use a screen reader to add members to a distribution group in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

Using a screen reader with the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online, you can add and remove members of a distribution group.

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans. But capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) and [Exchange Online Service Description.](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).
