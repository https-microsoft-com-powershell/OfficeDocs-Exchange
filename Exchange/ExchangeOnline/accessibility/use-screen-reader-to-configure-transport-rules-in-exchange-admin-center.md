# Use a screen reader to configure mail flow rules in the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

Using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts, you can create mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) in Exchange Online in the Exchange admin center (EAC) to look for specific conditions in messages that pass through your organization and take action on them. The main difference between mail flow rules and Inbox rules you would set up in an email client application (such as Outlook) is that mail flow rules take action on messages while they're in transit as opposed to after the message is delivered. Mail flow rules also contain a richer set of conditions, exceptions, and actions, which provides you with the flexibility to implement many types of messaging policies.

 **Note**: To learn more about mail flow rules, see [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](../security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules.md).

## Get started

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan and admin role to perform this task. Then, open the EAC and get started.

### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).

For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17456/).

Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows. In your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479) for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

### Confirm your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in several different subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role
