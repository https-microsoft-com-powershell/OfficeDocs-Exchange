# Mail flow rule conditions and exceptions (predicates) in Exchange Online

Conditions and exceptions in mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) identify the messages that the rule is applied to or not applied to. For example, if the rule adds a disclaimer to messages, you can configure the rule to only apply to messages that contain specific words, messages sent by specific users, or to all messages except those sent by the members of a specific distribution group. Collectively, the conditions and exceptions in mail flow rules are also known as _predicates_, because for every condition, there's a corresponding exception that uses the exact same settings and syntax. The only difference is conditions specify messages to include, while exceptions specify messages to exclude.

Most conditions and exceptions have one property that requires one or more values. For example, the **The sender is** condition requires the sender of the message. Some conditions have two properties. For example, the **A message header includes any of these words** condition requires one property to specify the message header field, and a second property to specify the text to look for in the header field. Some conditions or exceptions don't have any properties. For example, the **Any attachment has executable content** condition simply looks for attachments in messages that have executable content.

For more information about mail flow rules in Exchange Online, including how multiple conditions/exceptions or multi-valued conditions/exceptions are handled, see [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](mail-flow-rules.md).

## Conditions and exceptions for mail flow rules in Exchange Online

The tables in the following sections describe the conditions and exceptions that are available in mail flow rules in Exchange Online. The property types are described in the [Property types](#property-types) section.

[Senders](#senders)

[Recipients](#recipients)

[Message subject or body](#message-subject-or-body)

[Attachments](#attachments)

[Any recipients](#any-recipients)

[Message sensitive information types, To and Cc values, size, and character sets](#message-sensitive-information-types-to-and-cc-values-size-and-character-sets)

[Sender and recipient](#sender-and-recipient)

[Message properties](#message-properties)

[Message headers](#message-headers)

 **Notes**:

- After you select a condition or exception in the Exchange admin center (EAC), the value that's ultimately shown in the **Apply this rule if** or **Except if** field is often different (shorter) than the click path value you selected. Also, when you create new rules based on a template (a filtered list of scenarios), you can often select a short condition name instead of following the complete click path. The short names and full click path values are shown in the EAC column in the tables.

- If you select **[Apply to all messages]** in the EAC, you can't specify any other conditions. The equivalent in PowerShell is to create a rule without specifying any condition parameters.

- The settings and properties are the same in conditions and exceptions, so the output of the **Get-TransportRulePredicate** cmdlet doesn't list exceptions separately. Also, the names of some of the predicates that are returned by this cmdlet are different than the corresponding parameter names, and a predicate might require multiple parameters.

### Senders

For conditions and exceptions that examine the sender's address, you can specify where rule looks for the sender's address.

In the EAC, in the **Properties of this rule** section, click **Match sender address in message**. Note that you might need to click **More options** to see this setting. In PowerShell, the parameter is _SenderAddressLocation_. The available values are:

- **Header**: Only examine senders in the message headers (for example, the **From**, **Sender**, or **Reply-To** fields). This is the default value.

- **Envelope**: Only examine senders from the message envelope (the **MAIL FROM** value that was used in the SMTP transmission, which is typically stored in the **Return-Path** field). Note that message envelope searching is only available for the following conditions (and the corresponding exceptions):
  - **The sender is**(_From_)
  - **The sender is a member of**(_FromMemberOf_)
  - **The sender address includes**(_FromAddressContainsWords_)
  - **The sender address matches**(_FromAddressMatchesPatterns_)
  - **The sender's domain is**(_SenderDomainIs_)

- **Header or envelope** (`HeaderOrEnvelope`) Examine senders in the message header and the message envelope.

### Message subject or body

> [!NOTE]
> The search for words or text patterns in the subject or other header fields in the message occurs *after* the message has been decoded from the MIME content transfer encoding method that was used to transmit the binary message between SMTP servers in ASCII text. You can't use conditions or exceptions to search for the raw (typically, Base64) encoded values of the subject or other header fields in messages.

<br>

|

### Any recipients

The conditions and exceptions in this section provide a unique capability that affects *all* recipients when the message contains at least one of the specified recipients. For example, let's say you have a rule that rejects messages. If you use a recipient condition from the [Recipients](#recipients) section, the message is only rejected for those specified recipients. For example, if the rule finds the specified recipient in a message, but the message contains five other recipients. The message is rejected for that one recipient, and is delivered to the five other recipients.

If you add a recipient condition from this section, that same message is rejected for the detected recipient and the five other recipients.

Conversely, a recipient exception from this section *prevents* the rule action from being applied to *all* recipients of the message, not just for the detected recipients.

 **Note**: This condition doesn't consider messages that are sent to recipient proxy addresses. It only matches messages that are sent to the recipient's primary email address.

<br>

****

|Condition or exception in the EAC|Condition and exception parameters in Exchange Online PowerShell|Property type|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Any recipient address includes** <p> **Any recipient** \> **address includes any of these words**|_AnyOfRecipientAddressContainsWords_ <br/> _ExceptIfAnyOfRecipientAddressContainsWords_|`Words`|Messages that contain the specified words in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** fields of the message.|
|**Any recipient address matches** <p> **Any recipient** \> **address matches any of these text patterns**|_AnyOfRecipientAddressMatchesPatterns_ <br/> _ExceptIfAnyOfRecipientAddressMatchesPatterns_|`Patterns`|Messages where the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** fields contain text patterns that match the specified regular expressions.|
|

### Message sensitive information types, To and Cc values, size, and character sets

The conditions in this section that look for values in the **To** and **Cc** fields behave like the conditions in the [Any recipients](#any-recipients) section (*all* recipients of the message are affected by the rule, not just the detected recipients).

**Notes**:

- The recipient conditions in this section do not consider messages that are sent to recipient proxy addresses. They only match messages that are sent to the recipient's primary email address.
- For more information about using Microsoft 365 groups with the recipient conditions in this section, see the Addresses entry in the [Property types](#property-types) section.

## Property types

The property types that are used in conditions and exceptions are described in the following table.

> [!NOTE]
> If the property is a string, trailing spaces are not allowed.

<br>

****

|Property type|Valid values|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`ADAttribute`|Select from a predefined list of Active Directory attributes|You can check against any of the following Active Directory attributes: <ul><li>**City**</li><li>**Company**</li><li>**Country**</li><li>**CustomAttribute1 - CustomAttribute15**</li><li>**Department**</li><li>**DisplayName**</li><li>**Email**</li><li>**FaxNumber**</li><li>**FirstName**</li><li>**HomePhoneNumber**</li><li>**Initials**</li><li>**LastName**</li><li>**Manager**</li><li>**MobileNumber**</li><li>**Notes**</li><li>**Office**</li><li>**OtherFaxNumber**</li><li>**OtherHomePhoneNumber**</li><li>**OtherPhoneNumber**</li><li>**PagerNumber**</li><li>**PhoneNumber**</li><li>**POBox**</li><li>**State**</li><li>**Street**</li><li>**Title**</li><li>**UserLogonName**</li><li>**ZipCode**</li></ul> <p> In the EAC, to specify multiple words or text patterns for the same attribute, separate the values with commas. For example, the value `San Francisco,Palo Alto` for the **City** attribute looks for "City equals San Francisco" or City equals Palo Alto". <p> In Exchange Online PowerShell, use the syntax `"AttributeName1:Value1,Value 2 with spaces,Value3...","AttributeName2:Word4,Value 5 with spaces,Value6..."`, where `Value` is the word or text pattern that you want to match. For example, `"City:San Francisco,Palo Alto"` or `"City:San Francisco,Palo Alto"`, `"Department:Sales,Finance"`. <p> When you specify multiple attributes, or multiple values for the same attribute, the **or** operator is used. Don't use values with leading or trailing spaces. <p> Note that the **Country** attribute requires the two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code value (for example, DE for Germany). For more information, see [Country Codes - ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).|
|`Addresses`|Exchange Online recipients|Depending on the nature of the condition or exception, you might be able to specify any mail-enabled object in the organization (for example, recipient-related conditions), or you might be limited to a specific object type (for example, groups for group membership conditions). And, the condition or exception might require one value, or allow multiple values. <p> In Exchange Online PowerShell, separate multiple values by commas. <p> This condition doesn't consider messages that are sent to recipient proxy addresses. It only matches messages that are sent to the recipient's primary email address. <p> The recipient picker in the EAC doesn't allow you to select Microsoft 365 groups from the list of recipients.
