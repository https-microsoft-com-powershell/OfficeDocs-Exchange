# Use mail flow rules to automatically add meetings to calendars in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> This article does not apply to standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations.

With the Direct to Calendar feature in Exchange Online, admins can configure mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) that allow designated users to add meetings to calendars. The benefits of Direct to Calendar are:

- The event is automatically added to the recipient's calendar without any action from them. If the user received the meeting invitation, it's on their calendar.
- The sender doesn't need to deal with Out of Office or other unwanted response messages that result from sending meeting invitations to a large number of recipients.
- No meeting-related messages are seen by attendees unless the meeting is cancelled.

Direct to Calendar requires two mail flow rules with specific conditions and actions. These rules are described in the following table:

<br>

****

|Rule description|Condition|Action|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|This mail flow rule turns regular meeting invitations into Direct to Calendar meeting invitations.|**The sender is** or **The sender** \> **is this person** (the _From_ parameter). <p> This condition identifies the users who are authorized to send Direct to Calendar meeting invitations. Although you can use other conditions, restricting the invitations by sender helps prevent unauthorized use of Direct to Calendar meeting invitations.|**Set the message header to this value** or **Modify the message properties** \> **set a message header** (the _SetHeaderName_ and _SetHeaderValue_ parameters). <p> This action sets the **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-Response** header to the value `Accept`. Other valid values are `Tentative` and `Decline`.|We recommend that you use dedicated mailboxes (shared mailboxes are OK) for sending Direct to Calendar meeting invitations, because *any* meeting invitations from these senders will be automatically added to recipient calendars. <p> The dedicated mailboxes require no special permissions to send Direct to Calendar meeting invitations.|
|This mail flow rule prevents Direct to Calendar meeting invitations from appearing in the Inbox of recipients.|**The sender is** or **The sender** \> **is this person** (the _From_ parameter).|**Set the message header to this value** or **Modify the message properties** \> **set a message header** (the _SetHeaderName_ and _SetHeaderValue_ parameters). <p> This action sets the **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-TriageAction** header to the value `MoveToDeletedItems`. The other valid value is `None`.|Technically, this rule is optional (without it, meetings are still automatically added to recipient calendars). <p> Note that this rule doesn't prevent meeting cancellation messages for Direct to Calendar meetings from appearing in the Inbox of recipients.|

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to create Direct to Calendar mail flow rules

1. To create the mail flow rule that turns regular meeting invitations into Direct to Calendar meeting invitations, use the following syntax:

   ```PowerShell
   New-TransportRule -Name "Direct to Calendar response" -From "<designated sender 1>","<designated sender 2>"... -SetHeaderName "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-Response" -SetHeaderValue Accept
   ```

   This example configures the rule using the dedicated mailbox named Direct to Calendar invites.

   ```PowerShell
   New-TransportRule -Name "Direct to Calendar response" -From "Direct to Calendar invites" -SetHeaderName "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-Response" -SetHeaderValue Accept
   ```

2. To create the mail flow rule that prevents Direct to Calendar meeting invitations from appearing in the Inbox of recipients, use the following syntax:

   ```PowerShell
   New-TransportRule -Name "Direct to Calendar triage action" -From "<designated sender 1>","<designated sender 2>"... -SetHeaderName "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-TriageAction" -SetHeaderValue MoveToDeletedItems
   ```

   This example configures the rule using the dedicated mailbox named Direct to Calendar invites.

   ```PowerShell
   New-TransportRule -Name "Direct to Calendar triage action" -From "Direct to Calendar invites" -SetHeaderName "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-CalendarBooking-TriageAction" -SetHeaderValue MoveToDeletedItems
   ```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-TransportRule](/powershell/module/exchange/new-transportrule).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have successfully configured Direct to Calendar meeting invitations, use the designated sender mailbox to send a test meeting invitation to a small number of recipients. Verify that the meeting automatically appears in the calendars of the recipients, and verify there are no meeting-related messages in the Inbox (the second rule should automatically move these messages to the Deleted Items folder).

## More information

- The designated sender mailbox will receive meeting acceptance responses to Direct to Calendar meetings. Use the following strategies to help minimize the impact of these messages on the designated sender:

  - In Outlook, enable the **Update tracking information, and then delete responses that don't contain comments** and **After updating tracking information, move receipt to \<Deleted Items\>** settings in **Mail** \> **Tracking** for the designated sender mailbox. For more information, see [Change how meeting requests, polls, and read or delivery receipts are processed](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3e18ef46-57c0-4e49-ad89-b44ae75596ed).

  - Clearing the **Request Responses** setting in Direct to Calendar meeting invitations doesn't prevent responses from being sent back to the designated sender mailbox.

- If the designated mailbox sends a meeting cancellation for a Direct to Calendar meeting, the cancelled meeting title is always changed to **CANCELED: \<previous meeting title\>**, and the cancelled meeting remains in the calendars of attendees until they manually remove it.

- Meeting cancellation messages for Direct to Calendar meetings will always appear in the Inbox of recipients.
