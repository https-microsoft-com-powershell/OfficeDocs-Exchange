# Enable or disable journaling of voice mail and missed call notifications

In Exchange Online, when you create a journal rule to journal email messages sent to or from recipients or senders in an Exchange organization, voice mail and missed call notifications generated by the Unified Messaging (UM) service are included. Use the procedures in this topic to turn this feature on or off for your entire organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When voice mail journaling is disabled, the following messages classes won't be journaled. It's important to be aware that messages that are "spoofed" using these message classes will not be journaled.

```text
"IPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM"
"IPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM.CA"
"IPM.Note.Microsoft.Missed.Voice"
"IPM.Note.rpmsg.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM.CA"
"IPM.Note.rpmsg.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM"
```
