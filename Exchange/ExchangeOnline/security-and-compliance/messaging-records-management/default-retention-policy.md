# Default Retention Policy in Exchange Online and Exchange Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please refer to the [Microsoft 365 security center](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage) and the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/homepage) for Exchange security and compliance features. They are no longer available in the new [Exchange Admin Center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com).

> [!NOTE]
> To proactively retain or delete mailbox content for information governance in Microsoft 365, we recommend that you use [retention policies and retention labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/retention) from the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), instead of messaging records management that's described on this page. However, you should continue using messaging records management to move messages to archive mailboxes.
> 
> If you currently use messaging records management, this older feature will continue to work side-by-side with retention policies and retention labels. However, we recommend that going forward, you use retention policies and retention labels instead. They provide you with a single mechanism to centrally manage both retention and deletion of content across Microsoft 365.

Exchange creates the retention policy Default MRM Policy in your Exchange Online and on-premises Exchange organization. The policy is automatically applied to new users in Exchange Online. In on-premises organizations, the policy is applied when you create an archive for the mailbox. You can change the retention policy applied to a user at any time.

You can modify tags included in the Default MRM Policy, for example by changing the retention age or retention actions, disable a tag, or modify the policy by adding or removing tags from it. The updated policy is applied to mailboxes the next time they're processed by the Managed Folder Assistant

## More information

- A Retention Tag can be linked to more than one Retention Policy. For details about managing [Retention tags and retention policies](retention-tags-and-policies.md), see [Messaging Records Management Procedures](/microsoft-365/compliance/inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365).

- The Default MRM Policy doesn't include a DPT to automatically delete items (but it does contain personal tags with the delete retention action that users can apply to mailbox items). If you want to automatically delete items after a specified period, you can create a DPT with the required delete action and add it to the policy. For details, see [Create a Retention Policy](create-a-retention-policy.md) and [Add retention tags to or remove retention tags from a retention policy](add-or-remove-retention-tags.md).

- Retention policies are applied to mailbox users. The same policy applies to the user's mailbox and archive.
