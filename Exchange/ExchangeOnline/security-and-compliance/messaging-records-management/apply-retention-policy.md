# Apply a retention policy to mailboxes

> [!NOTE]
> To proactively retain or delete mailbox content for information governance in Microsoft 365, we recommend that you use [retention policies and retention labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/retention) from the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), instead of messaging records management that's described on this page. However, you should continue using messaging records management to move messages to archive mailboxes.
> 
> If you currently use messaging records management, this older feature will continue to work side-by-side with retention policies and retention labels. However, we recommend that going forward, you use retention policies and retention labels instead. They provide you with a single mechanism to centrally manage both retention and deletion of content across Microsoft 365.

You can use retention policies to group one or more retention tags and apply them to mailboxes to enforce message retention settings. A mailbox can't have more than one retention policy.

> [!CAUTION]
> Messages are expired based on settings defined in the retention tags linked to the policy. These settings include actions such moving messages to the archive or permanently deleting them. Before applying a retention policy to one or more mailboxes, we recommended that you test the policy and inspect each retention tag associated with it.

For additional management tasks related to messaging records management (MRM), see [Messaging Records Management Procedures](/microsoft-365/compliance/inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to apply a retention policy to a single mailbox

This example applies the retention policy RP-Finance to Morris's mailbox.

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox "Morris" -RetentionPolicy "RP-Finance"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailbox).

## Use Exchange Online PowerShell to apply a retention policy to multiple mailboxes

This example applies the new retention policy New-Retention-Policy to all mailboxes that have the old policy Old-Retention-Policy.

```PowerShell
$OldPolicy=(Get-RetentionPolicy "Old-Retention-Policy").distinguishedName
Get-Mailbox -Filter "RetentionPolicy -eq '$OldPolicy'" -Resultsize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "New-Retention-Policy"
```

This example applies the retention policy RetentionPolicy-Corp to all mailboxes in the Exchange organization.

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "RetentionPolicy-Corp"
```

This example applies the retention policy RetentionPolicy-Finance to all mailboxes in the Finance organizational unit.

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit "Finance" -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "RetentionPolicy-Finance"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) and [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailbox).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have applied the retention policy, run the [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) cmdlet to retrieve the retention policy for the mailbox or mailboxes.

This example retrieves the retention policy for Morris's mailbox.

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox Morris | Select RetentionPolicy
```

This command retrieves all mailboxes that have the retention policy RP-Finance applied.

```PowerShell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Where-Object {$_.RetentionPolicy -eq "RP-Finance"} | Format-Table Name,RetentionPolicy -Auto
```
