# Export mailbox audit logs in Exchange Online

When mailbox auditing is enabled for a mailbox, Exchange Online logs information in the mailbox audit log whenever a user other than the owner accesses the mailbox. Each log entry includes information about who accessed the mailbox and when, the actions performed by the non-owner, and whether the action was successful. Entries in the mailbox audit log are retained for 90 days by default. You can use the mailbox audit log to determine if a user other than the owner has accessed a mailbox.

When you export entries from mailbox audit logs, Exchange Online saves the entries in an XML file and attaches it to an email message sent to the specified recipients.

## Before you begin

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: varies. The mailbox audit log is sent within a few days after you export it.

- As of January 2019, mailbox audit logging on by default is enabled for all Exchange Online organizations. For more information, see [Manage mailbox auditing](/microsoft-365/compliance/enable-mailbox-auditing).

- If you're going to use Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to view the exported entries, you need to enable .xml attachments in Outlook on the web. For details, see [Configure Outlook on the web to allow XML attachments](exchange-auditing-reports.md#configure-outlook-on-the-web-to-allow-xml-attachments).

- To find and open the Exchange admin center (EAC), see, [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](../../exchange-admin-center.md).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure. To see what permissions you need, see the "View reports" entry in the [Feature permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions-exo/feature-permissions.md) topic.

- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts for the Exchange admin center](../../accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts-in-admin-center.md).

## Export the mailbox audit log

1. In the EAC, go to **Compliance Management** \> **Auditing**.

2. Click **Export mailbox audit logs**.

3. Configure the following search criteria for exporting the entries from the mailbox audit log:
   - **Start and end dates**: Select the date range for the entries to include in the exported file.
   - **Mailboxes to search audit log for**: Select the mailboxes to retrieve audit log entries for.
   - **Type of non-owner access**: Select one of the following options to define the type of non-owner access to retrieve entries for:
     - **All non-owners**: Search for access by admins and delegated users inside your organization, and by Microsoft datacenter administrators in Exchange Online.
     - **External users**: Search for access by Microsoft datacenter administrators.
     - **Administrators and delegated users**: Search for access by admins and delegated users inside your organization.
     - **Administrators**: Search for access by admins in your organization.
   - **Recipients**: Select the users to send the mailbox audit log to.

4. Click **Export**.

Exchange Online retrieves entries in the mailbox audit log that meet your search criteria, saves them to a file named SearchResult.xml, and then attaches the XML file to an email message sent to the recipients that you specified.

### How do you know this worked?

Sign in to the mailbox where the mailbox audit log was sent. If you've successfully exported the audit log, you'll receive a message sent from Exchange. It might take a few days to receive this message. The mailbox audit log (named SearchResult.xml) will be attached to this message. If you've correctly configured Outlook on the web to allow XML attachments, you can download the attached XML file.

## View the mailbox audit log

To save and view the SearchResult.xml file:

1. Sign in to the mailbox where the mailbox audit log was sent.
2. In the Inbox, open the message with the XML file attachment sent by Exchange Online. Notice that the body of the email message contains the search criteria.
3. Click the attachment and select to download the XML file.
4. Open the SearchResult.xml in Microsoft Excel.
